Part One

1984

Chapter i

It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were strik-ing thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into hisbreast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quicklythrough the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though notquickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from enter-ing along with him.

The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. Atone end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display,had been tacked to the wall. It depicted simply an enor-mous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man ofabout forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and rugged-ly handsome features. Winston made for the stairs. It wasno use trying the lift. Even at the best of times it was sel-dom working, and at present the electric current was cutoff during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drivein preparation for Hate Week. The flat was seven flights up,and Winston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcerabove his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times onthe way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the posterwith the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one ofthose pictures which are so contrived that the eyes followyou about when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHINGYOU, the caption beneath it ran.

Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of fig-

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 3

ures which had something to do with the production ofpig-iron. The voice came from an oblong metal plaque likea dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of theright-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voicesank somewhat, though the words were still distinguish-able. The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could bedimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off complete-ly. He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail figure,the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blueoveralls which were the uniform of the party. His hair wasvery fair, his face naturally sanguine, his skin roughened bycoarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the win-ter that had just ended.

Outside, even through the shut window-pane, the worldlooked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind werewhirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though thesun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemedto be no colour in anything, except the posters that wereplastered everywhere. The blackmoustachio'd face gazeddown from every commanding corner. There was one onthe house-front immediately opposite. BIG BROTHER ISWATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark eyeslooked deep into Winston's own. Down at street level an-other poster, torn at one corner, flapped fitfully in the wind,alternately covering and uncovering the single word IN-GSOC. In the far distance a helicopter skimmed downbetween the roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle,and darted away again with a curving flight. It was the po-lice patrol, snooping into people's windows. The patrols did

1984

not matter, however. Only the Thought Police mattered.

Behind Winston's back the voice from the telescreen wasstill babbling away about pig-iron and the overfulfilmentof the Ninth Three-Year Plan. The telescreen received andtransmitted simultaneously. Any sound that Winston made,above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up byit, moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vi-sion which the metal plaque commanded, he could be seenas well as heard. There was of course no way of knowingwhether you were being watched at any given moment. Howoften, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in onany individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivablethat they watched everybody all the time. But at any ratethey could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. Youhad to live—did live, from habit that became instinct—inthe assumption that every sound you made was overheard,and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized.

Winston kept his back turned to the telescreen. It wassafer, though, as he well knew, even a back can be revealing.A kilometre away the Ministry of Truth, his place of work,towered vast and white above the grimy landscape. This,he thought with a sort of vague distaste—this was London,chief city of Airstrip One, itself the third most populousof the provinces of Oceania. He tried to squeeze out somechildhood memory that should tell him whether Londonhad always been quite like this. Were there always these vis-tas of rotting nineteenth-century houses, their sides shoredup with baulks of timber, their windows patched with card-board and their roofs with corrugated iron, their crazy

garden walls sagging in all directions? And the bombedsites where the plaster dust swirled in the air and the wil-low-herb straggled over the heaps of rubble; and the placeswhere the bombs had cleared a larger patch and there hadsprung up sordid colonies of wooden dwellings like chick-en-houses? But it was no use, he could not remember:nothing remained of his childhood except a series of bright-lit tableaux occurring against no background and mostlyunintelligible.

The Ministry of Truth—Minitrue, in Newspeak [New-speak was the official language of Oceania. For an accountof its structure and etymology see Appendix.]—was star-tlingly different from any other object in sight. It was anenormous pyramidal structure of glittering white con-crete, soaring up, terrace after terrace, 300 metres into theair. From where Winston stood it was just possible to read,picked out on its white face in elegant lettering, the threeslogans of the Party:

WAR IS PEACE

FREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH

The Ministry of Truth contained, it was said, threethousand rooms above ground level, and correspondingramifications below. Scattered about London there werejust three other buildings of similar appearance and size.So completely did they dwarf the surrounding architec-ture that from the roof of Victory Mansions you could see

all four of them simultaneously. They were the homes ofthe four Ministries between which the entire apparatusof government was divided. The Ministry of Truth, whichconcerned itself with news, entertainment, education, andthe fine arts. The Ministry of Peace, which concerned itselfwith war. The Ministry of Love, which maintained law andorder. And the Ministry of Plenty, which was responsiblefor economic affairs. Their names, in Newspeak: Minitrue,Minipax, Miniluv, and Miniplenty

The Ministry of Love was the really frightening one.There were no windows in it at all. Winston had never beeninside the Ministry of Love, nor within half a kilometre of it.It was a place impossible to enter except on official business,and then only by penetrating through a maze of barbed-wire entanglements, steel doors, and hidden machine-gunnests. Even the streets leading up to its outer barriers wereroamed by gorilla-faced guards in black uniforms, armedwith jointed truncheons.

Winston turned round abruptly. He had set his featuresinto the expression of quiet optimism which it was advis-able to wear when facing the telescreen. He crossed theroom into the tiny kitchen. By leaving the Ministry at thistime of day he had sacrificed his lunch in the canteen, andhe was aware that there was no food in the kitchen excepta hunk of dark-coloured bread which had got to be savedfor tomorrow's breakfast. He took down from the shelf abottle of colourless liquid with a plain white label markedVICTORY GIN. It gave off a sickly, oily smell, as of Chineserice-spirit. Winston poured out nearly a teacupful, nerved

himself for a shock, and gulped it down like a dose of medi-cine.

Instantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran outof his eyes. The stuff was like nitric acid, and moreover, inswallowing it one had the sensation of being hit on the backof the head with a rubber club. The next moment, however,the burning in his belly died down and the world began tolook more cheerful. He took a cigarette from a crumpledpacket marked VICTORY CIGARETTES and incautiouslyheld it upright, whereupon the tobacco fell out on to thefloor. With the next he was more successful. He went backto the living-room and sat down at a small table that stoodto the left of the telescreen. From the table drawer he tookout a penholder, a bottle of ink, and a thick, quarto-sizedblank book with a red back and a marbled cover.

For some reason the telescreen in the living-room was inan unusual position. Instead of being placed, as was normal,in the end wall, where it could command the whole room,it was in the longer wall, opposite the window. To one sideof it there was a shallow alcove in which Winston was nowsitting, and which, when the flats were built, had probablybeen intended to hold bookshelves. By sitting in the alcove,and keeping well back, Winston was able to remain outsidethe range of the telescreen, so far as sight went. He couldbe heard, of course, but so long as he stayed in his presentposition he could not be seen. It was partly the unusual ge-ography of the room that had suggested to him the thingthat he was now about to do.

But it had also been suggested by the book that he had

1984

just taken out of the drawer. It was a peculiarly beautifulbook. Its smooth creamy paper, a little yellowed by age, wasof a kind that had not been manufactured for at least for-ty years past. He could guess, however, that the book wasmuch older than that. He had seen it lying in the window ofa frowsy little junk-shop in a slummy quarter of the town(just what quarter he did not now remember) and had beenstricken immediately by an overwhelming desire to possessit. Party members were supposed not to go into ordinaryshops ('dealing on the free market', it was called), but therule was not strictly kept, because there were various things,such as shoelaces and razor blades, which it was impossibleto get hold of in any other way. He had given a quick glanceup and down the street and then had slipped inside andbought the book for two dollars fifty At the time he was notconscious of wanting it for any particular purpose. He hadcarried it guiltily home in his briefcase. Even with nothingwritten in it, it was a compromising possession.

The thing that he was about to do was to open a diary.This was not illegal (nothing was illegal, since there were nolonger any laws), but if detected it was reasonably certainthat it would be punished by death, or at least by twenty-five years in a forced-labour camp. Winston fitted a nib intothe penholder and sucked it to get the grease off. The penwas an archaic instrument, seldom used even for signatures,and he had procured one, furtively and with some difficulty,simply because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paperdeserved to be written on with a real nib instead of beingscratched with an ink-pencil. Actually he was not used to

writing by hand. Apart from very short notes, it was usu-al to dictate everything into the speak-write which was ofcourse impossible for his present purpose. He dipped thepen into the ink and then faltered for just a second. A trem-or had gone through his bowels. To mark the paper was thedecisive act. In small clumsy letters he wrote:

April 4th, 1984.

He sat back. A sense of complete helplessness had de-scended upon him. To begin with, he did not know with anycertainty that this was 1984. It must be round about thatdate, since he was fairly sure that his age was thirty-nine,and he believed that he had been born in 1944 or 1945; butit was never possible nowadays to pin down any date withina year or two.

For whom, it suddenly occurred to him to wonder, was hewriting this diary? For the future, for the unborn. His mindhovered for a moment round the doubtful date on the page,and then fetched up with a bump against the Newspeakword DOUBLETHINK. For the first time the magnitude ofwhat he had undertaken came home to him. How could youcommunicate with the future? It was of its nature impossi-ble. Either the future would resemble the present, in whichcase it would not listen to him: or it would be different fromit, and his predicament would be meaningless.

For some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper. Thetelescreen had changed over to strident military music. Itwas curious that he seemed not merely to have lost the pow-

1984

er of expressing himself, but even to have forgotten what itwas that he had originally intended to say. For weeks pasthe had been making ready for this moment, and it had nev-er crossed his mind that anything would be needed exceptcourage. The actual writing would be easy. All he had todo was to transfer to paper the interminable restless mono-logue that had been running inside his head, literally foryears. At this moment, however, even the monologue haddried up. Moreover his varicose ulcer had begun itchingunbearably. He dared not scratch it, because if he did so italways became inflamed. The seconds were ticking by. Hewas conscious of nothing except the blankness of the pagein front of him, the itching of the skin above his ankle, theblaring of the music, and a slight booziness caused by the

gin-Suddenly he began writing in sheer panic, only imper-fectly aware of what he was setting down. His small butchildish handwriting straggled up and down the page, shed-ding first its capital letters and finally even its full stops:

Winston stopped writing, partly because he was suffer-ing from cramp. He did not know what had made him pourout this stream of rubbish. But the curious thing was thatwhile he was doing so a totally different memory had clar-ified itself in his mind, to the point where he almost feltequal to writing it down. It was, he now realized, becauseof this other incident that he had suddenly decided to come

1984

home and begin the diary today.

It had happened that morning at the Ministry, if any-thing so nebulous could be said to happen.

It was nearly eleven hundred, and in the Records De-partment, where Winston worked, they were dragging thechairs out of the cubicles and grouping them in the cen-tre of the hall opposite the big telescreen, in preparation forthe Two Minutes Hate. Winston was just taking his placein one of the middle rows when two people whom he knewby sight, but had never spoken to, came unexpectedly intothe room. One of them was a girl whom he often passed inthe corridors. He did not know her name, but he knew thatshe worked in the Fiction Department. Presumably—sincehe had sometimes seen her with oily hands and carrying aspanner—she had some mechanical job on one of the nov-el-writing machines. She was a bold-looking girl, of abouttwenty-seven, with thick hair, a freckled face, and swift,athletic movements. A narrow scarlet sash, emblem of theJunior Anti-Sex League, was wound several times roundthe waist of her overalls, just tightly enough to bring out theshapeliness of her hips. Winston had disliked her from thevery first moment of seeing her. He knew the reason. It wasbecause of the atmosphere of hockey-fields and cold bathsand community hikes and general clean-mindedness whichshe managed to carry about with her. He disliked nearly allwomen, and especially the young and pretty ones. It was al-ways the women, and above all the young ones, who werethe most bigoted adherents of the Party, the swallowersof slogans, the amateur spies and nosers-out of unortho-

doxy. But this particular girl gave him the impression ofbeing more dangerous than most. Once when they passedin the corridor she gave him a quick sidelong glance whichseemed to pierce right into him and for a moment had filledhim with black terror. The idea had even crossed his mindthat she might be an agent of the Thought Police. That, itwas true, was very unlikely. Still, he continued to feel a pe-culiar uneasiness, which had fear mixed up in it as well ashostility, whenever she was anywhere near him.

The other person was a man named O'Brien, a memberof the Inner Party and holder of some post so importantand remote that Winston had only a dim idea of its nature.A momentary hush passed over the group of people roundthe chairs as they saw the black overalls of an Inner Partymember approaching. O'Brien was a large, burly man witha thick neck and a coarse, humorous, brutal face. In spite ofhis formidable appearance he had a certain charm of man-ner. He had a trick of resettling his spectacles on his nosewhich was curiously disarming—in some indefinable way,curiously civilized. It was a gesture which, if anyone hadstill thought in such terms, might have recalled an eigh-teenth-century nobleman offering his snuffbox. Winstonhad seen O'Brien perhaps a dozen times in almost as manyyears. He felt deeply drawn to him, and not solely becausehe was intrigued by the contrast between O'Brien's urbanemanner and his prize-fighter's physique. Much more it wasbecause of a secretly held belief—or perhaps not even a be-lief, merely a hope—that O'Brien's political orthodoxy wasnot perfect. Something in his face suggested it irresistibly.

1984

And again, perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that waswritten in his face, but simply intelligence. But at any ratehe had the appearance of being a person that you couldtalk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and gethim alone. Winston had never made the smallest effort toverify this guess: indeed, there was no way of doing so. Atthis moment O'Brien glanced at his wrist-watch, saw that itwas nearly eleven hundred, and evidently decided to stay inthe Records Department until the Two Minutes Hate wasover. He took a chair in the same row as Winston, a coupleof places away. A small, sandy-haired woman who workedin the next cubicle to Winston was between them. The girlwith dark hair was sitting immediately behind.

The next moment a hideous, grinding speech, as of somemonstrous machine running without oil, burst from thebig telescreen at the end of the room. It was a noise that setone's teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the back of one'sneck. The Hate had started.

As usual, the face of Emmanuel Goldstein, the Enemy ofthe People, had flashed on to the screen. There were hisseshere and there among the audience. The little sandy-hairedwoman gave a squeak of mingled fear and disgust. Gold-stein was the renegade and backslider who once, long ago(how long ago, nobody quite remembered), had been one ofthe leading figures of the Party, almost on a level with BigBrother himself, and then had engaged in counter-revolu-tionary activities, had been condemned to death, and hadmysteriously escaped and disappeared. The programmes ofthe Two Minutes Hate varied from day to day, but there was

none in which Goldstein was not the principal figure. Hewas the primal traitor, the earliest defiler of the Party's pu-rity. All subsequent crimes against the Party, all treacheries,acts of sabotage, heresies, deviations, sprang directly outof his teaching. Somewhere or other he was still alive andhatching his conspiracies: perhaps somewhere beyond thesea, under the protection of his foreign paymasters, perhapseven—so it was occasionally rumoured—in some hiding-place in Oceania itself.

Winston's diaphragm was constricted. He could neversee the face of Goldstein without a painful mixture of emo-tions. It was a lean Jewish face, with a great fuzzy aureole ofwhite hair and a small goatee beard—a clever face, and yetsomehow inherently despicable, with a kind of senile sil-liness in the long thin nose, near the end of which a pairof spectacles was perched. It resembled the face of a sheep,and the voice, too, had a sheep-like quality. Goldstein wasdelivering his usual venomous attack upon the doctrinesof the Party—an attack so exaggerated and perverse that achild should have been able to see through it, and yet justplausible enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling thatother people, less level-headed than oneself, might be takenin by it. He was abusing Big Brother, he was denouncingthe dictatorship of the Party, he was demanding the imme-diate conclusion of peace with Eurasia, he was advocatingfreedom of speech, freedom of the Press, freedom of as-sembly, freedom of thought, he was crying hysterically thatthe revolution had been betrayed—and all this in rapidpolysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the ha-

1984

bitual style of the orators of the Party, and even containedNewspeak words: more Newspeak words, indeed, than anyParty member would normally use in real life. And all thewhile, lest one should be in any doubt as to the reality whichGoldstein's specious claptrap covered, behind his head onthe telescreen there marched the endless columns of theEurasian army—row after row of solid-looking men withexpressionless Asiatic faces, who swam up to the surfaceof the screen and vanished, to be replaced by others exact-ly similar. The dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers' bootsformed the background to Goldstein's bleating voice.

Before the Hate had proceeded for thirty seconds, uncon-trollable exclamations of rage were breaking out from halfthe people in the room. The self-satisfied sheep-like face onthe screen, and the terrifying power of the Eurasian armybehind it, were too much to be borne: besides, the sight oreven the thought of Goldstein produced fear and anger au-tomatically. He was an object of hatred more constant thaneither Eurasia or Eastasia, since when Oceania was at warwith one of these Powers it was generally at peace with theother. But what was strange was that although Goldsteinwas hated and despised by everybody, although every dayand a thousand times a day, on platforms, on the telescreen,in newspapers, in books, his theories were refuted, smashed,ridiculed, held up to the general gaze for the pitiful rub-bish that they were—in spite of all this, his influence neverseemed to grow less. Always there were fresh dupes waitingto be seduced by him. A day never passed when spies andsaboteurs acting under his directions were not unmasked

by the Thought Police. He was the commander of a vastshadowy army, an underground network of conspiratorsdedicated to the overthrow of the State. The Brotherhood,its name was supposed to be. There were also whisperedstories of a terrible book, a compendium of all the heresies,of which Goldstein was the author and which circulatedclandestinely here and there. It was a book without a title.People referred to it, if at all, simply as THE BOOK. But oneknew of such things only through vague rumours. Neitherthe Brotherhood nor THE BOOK was a subject that any or-dinary Party member would mention if there was a way ofavoiding it.

In its second minute the Hate rose to a frenzy. Peoplewere leaping up and down in their places and shoutingat the tops of their voices in an effort to drown the mad-dening bleating voice that came from the screen. Thelittle sandy-haired woman had turned bright pink, andher mouth was opening and shutting like that of a landedfish. Even O'Brien's heavy face was flushed. He was sittingvery straight in his chair, his powerful chest swelling andquivering as though he were standing up to the assault of awave. The dark-haired girl behind Winston had begun cry-ing out 'Swine! Swine! Swine!' and suddenly she picked upa heavy Newspeak dictionary and flung it at the screen. Itstruck Goldstein's nose and bounced off; the voice contin-ued inexorably. In a lucid moment Winston found that hewas shouting with the others and kicking his heel violent-ly against the rung of his chair. The horrible thing aboutthe Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to act

18 1984

a part, but, on the contrary, that it was impossible to avoidjoining in. Within thirty seconds any pretence was alwaysunnecessary. A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness,a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledge-hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of peoplelike an electric current, turning one even against one's willinto a grimacing, screaming lunatic. And yet the rage thatone felt was an abstract, undirected emotion which couldbe switched from one object to another like the flame of ablowlamp. Thus, at one moment Winston's hatred was notturned against Goldstein at all, but, on the contrary, againstBig Brother, the Party, and the Thought Police; and at suchmoments his heart went out to the lonely, derided hereticon the screen, sole guardian of truth and sanity in a worldof lies. And yet the very next instant he was at one with thepeople about him, and all that was said of Goldstein seemedto him to be true. At those moments his secret loathing ofBig Brother changed into adoration, and Big Brother seemedto tower up, an invincible, fearless protector, standing likea rock against the hordes of Asia, and Goldstein, in spiteof his isolation, his helplessness, and the doubt that hungabout his very existence, seemed like some sinister enchant-er, capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking thestructure of civilization.

It was even possible, at moments, to switch one's ha-tred this way or that by a voluntary act. Suddenly, by thesort of violent effort with which one wrenches one's headaway from the pillow in a nightmare, Winston succeededin transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to

the dark-haired girl behind him. Vivid, beautiful hallucina-tions flashed through his mind. He would flog her to deathwith a rubber truncheon. He would tie her naked to a stakeand shoot her full of arrows like Saint Sebastian. He wouldravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax. Bet-ter than before, moreover, he realized WHY it was that hehated her. He hated her because she was young and prettyand sexless, because he wanted to go to bed with her andwould never do so, because round her sweet supple waist,which seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm, therewas only the odious scarlet sash, aggressive symbol of chas-tity.

The Hate rose to its climax. The voice of Goldstein hadbecome an actual sheep's bleat, and for an instant the facechanged into that of a sheep. Then the sheep -face melted intothe figure of a Eurasian soldier who seemed to be advancing,huge and terrible, his sub-machine gun roaring, and seem-ing to spring out of the surface of the screen, so that someof the people in the front row actually flinched backwardsin their seats. But in the same moment, drawing a deep sighof relief from everybody, the hostile figure melted into theface of Big Brother, black-haired, black-moustachio'd, fullof power and mysterious calm, and so vast that it almostfilled up the screen. Nobody heard what Big Brother wassaying. It was merely a few words of encouragement, thesort of words that are uttered in the din of battle, not distin-guishable individually but restoring confidence by the factof being spoken. Then the face of Big Brother faded awayagain, and instead the three slogans of the Party stood out

1984

in bold capitals:

WARE PEACE

FREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH

But the face of Big Brother seemed to persist for sever-al seconds on the screen, as though the impact that it hadmade on everyone's eyeballs was too vivid to wear off im-mediately. The little sandy-haired woman had flung herselfforward over the back of the chair in front of her. With atremulous murmur that sounded like 'My Saviour!' she ex-tended her arms towards the screen. Then she buried herface in her hands. It was apparent that she was uttering aprayer.

At this moment the entire group of people broke into adeep, slow, rhythmical chant of 'B-BL.B-B!'—over and overagain, very slowly, with a long pause between the first 'B'and the second—a heavy, murmurous sound, somehowcuriously savage, in the background of which one seemedto hear the stamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms. For perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept itup. It was a refrain that was often heard in moments ofoverwhelming emotion. Partly it was a sort of hymn to thewisdom and majesty of Big Brother, but still more it wasan act of self-hypnosis, a deliberate drowning of conscious-ness by means of rhythmic noise. Winston's entrails seemedto grow cold. In the Two Minutes Hate he could not helpsharing in the general delirium, but this sub-human chant-

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 21

ing of 'B-BL.B-B!' always filled him with horror. Of coursehe chanted with the rest: it was impossible to do otherwise.To dissemble your feelings, to control your face, to do whateveryone else was doing, was an instinctive reaction. Butthere was a space of a couple of seconds during which theexpression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed him.And it was exactly at this moment that the significant thinghappened—if, indeed, it did happen.

Momentarily he caught O'Brien's eye. O'Brien had stoodup. He had taken off his spectacles and was in the act ofresettling them on his nose with his characteristic gesture.But there was a fraction of a second when their eyes met,and for as long as it took to happen Winston knew—yes, heKNEW!—that O'Brien was thinking the same thing as him-self. An unmistakable message had passed. It was as thoughtheir two minds had opened and the thoughts were flowingfrom one into the other through their eyes. 'I am with you,'O'Brien seemed to be saying to him. 'I know precisely whatyou are feeling. I know all about your contempt, your ha-tred, your disgust. But don't worry, I am on your side!' Andthen the flash of intelligence was gone, and O'Brien's facewas as inscrutable as everybody else's.

That was all, and he was already uncertain whether it hadhappened. Such incidents never had any sequel. All that theydid was to keep alive in him the belief, or hope, that oth-ers besides himself were the enemies of the Party. Perhapsthe rumours of vast underground conspiracies were trueafter all—perhaps the Brotherhood really existed! It wasimpossible, in spite of the endless arrests and confessions

1984

and executions, to be sure that the Brotherhood was notsimply a myth. Some days he believed in it, some days not.There was no evidence, only fleeting glimpses that mightmean anything or nothing: snatches of overheard conver-sation, faint scribbles on lavatory walls—once, even, whentwo strangers met, a small movement of the hand whichhad looked as though it might be a signal of recognition. Itwas all guesswork: very likely he had imagined everything.He had gone back to his cubicle without looking at O'Brienagain. The idea of following up their momentary contacthardly crossed his mind. It would have been inconceivablydangerous even if he had known how to set about doing it.For a second, two seconds, they had exchanged an equivo-cal glance, and that was the end of the story. But even thatwas a memorable event, in the locked loneliness in whichone had to live.

Winston roused himself and sat up straighter. He let outa belch. The gin was rising from his stomach.

His eyes re-focused on the page. He discovered thatwhile he sat helplessly musing he had also been writing, asthough by automatic action. And it was no longer the samecramped, awkward handwriting as before. His pen had slidvoluptuously over the smooth paper, printing in large neatcapitals—DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER DOWN WITHBIG BROTHER DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER DOWNWITH BIG BROTHER DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER

over and over again, filling half a page.

He could not help feeling a twinge of panic. It was ab-surd, since the writing of those particular words was not

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 23

more dangerous than the initial act of opening the diary,but for a moment he was tempted to tear out the spoiledpages and abandon the enterprise altogether.

He did not do so, however, because he knew that it wasuseless. Whether he wrote DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER,or whether he refrained from writing it, made no differ-ence. Whether he went on with the diary, or whether he didnot go on with it, made no difference. The Thought Policewould get him just the same. He had committed—wouldstill have committed, even if he had never set pen to pa-per—the essential crime that contained all others in itself.Thoughtcrime, they called it. Thoughtcrime was not a thingthat could be concealed for ever. You might dodge success-fully for a while, even for years, but sooner or later theywere bound to get you.

It was always at night—the arrests invariably happenedat night. The sudden jerk out of sleep, the rough hand shak-ing your shoulder, the lights glaring in your eyes, the ring ofhard faces round the bed. In the vast majority of cases therewas no trial, no report of the arrest. People simply disap-peared, always during the night. Your name was removedfrom the registers, every record of everything you had everdone was wiped out, your one-time existence was deniedand then forgotten. You were abolished, annihilated: VA-PORIZED was the usual word.

For a moment he was seized by a kind of hysteria. He be-gan writing in a hurried untidy scrawl:

theyll shoot me i don't care theyll shoot me in the back of the

24 1984

neck i dont care down with big brother they always shoot youin the back of the neck i dont care down with big brother

He sat back in his chair, slightly ashamed of himself, andlaid down the pen. The next moment he started violently.There was a knocking at the door.

Already! He sat as still as a mouse, in the futile hope thatwhoever it was might go away after a single attempt. But no,the knocking was repeated. The worst thing of all would beto delay. His heart was thumping like a drum, but his face,from long habit, was probably expressionless. He got up andmoved heavily towards the door.

Chapter 2

As he put his hand to the door-knob Winston saw thathe had left the diary open on the table. DOWN WITHBIG BROTHER was written all over it, in letters almost bigenough to be legible across the room. It was an inconceiv-ably stupid thing to have done. But, he realized, even in hispanic he had not wanted to smudge the creamy paper byshutting the book while the ink was wet.

He drew in his breath and opened the door. Instantlya warm wave of relief flowed through him. A colourless,crushed-looking woman, with wispy hair and a lined face,was standing outside.

'Oh, comrade,' she began in a dreary, whining sort ofvoice, 'I thought I heard you come in. Do you think youcould come across and have a look at our kitchen sink? It'sgot blocked up and '

It was Mrs Parsons, the wife of a neighbour on the samefloor. ('Mrs' was a word somewhat discountenanced by theParty—you were supposed to call everyone 'comrade'—but with some women one used it instinctively.) She wasa woman of about thirty, but looking much older. One hadthe impression that there was dust in the creases of her face.Winston followed her down the passage. These amateur re-pair jobs were an almost daily irritation. Victory Mansionswere old flats, built in 1930 or thereabouts, and were falling

1984

to pieces. The plaster flaked constantly from ceilings andwalls, the pipes burst in every hard frost, the roof leakedwhenever there was snow, the heating system was usuallyrunning at half steam when it was not closed down alto-gether from motives of economy. Repairs, except what youcould do for yourself, had to be sanctioned by remote com-mittees which were liable to hold up even the mending of awindow-pane for two years.

'Of course it's only because Tom isn't home,' said MrsParsons vaguely.

The Parsons' flat was bigger than Winston's, and dingyin a different way. Everything had a battered, trampled-onlook, as though the place had just been visited by some largeviolent animal. Games impedimenta—hockey-sticks, box-ing-gloves, a burst football, a pair of sweaty shorts turnedinside out—lay all over the floor, and on the table there wasa litter of dirty dishes and dog-eared exercise-books. Onthe walls were scarlet banners of the Youth League and theSpies, and a full-sized poster of Big Brother. There was theusual boiled-cabbage smell, common to the whole building,but it was shot through by a sharper reek of sweat, which—one knew this at the first sniff, though it was hard to sayhow—was the sweat of some person not present at the mo-ment. In another room someone with a comb and a piece oftoilet paper was trying to keep tune with the military musicwhich was still issuing from the telescreen.

'It's the children,' said Mrs Parsons, casting a half-ap-prehensive glance at the door. 'They haven't been out today.And of course '

She had a habit of breaking off her sentences in the mid-dle. The kitchen sink was full nearly to the brim with filthygreenish water which smelt worse than ever of cabbage.Winston knelt down and examined the angle-joint of thepipe. He hated using his hands, and he hated bending down,which was always liable to start him coughing. Mrs Parsonslooked on helplessly.

'Of course if Tom was home he'd put it right in a mo-ment,' she said. 'He loves anything like that. He's ever sogood with his hands, Tom is.'

Parsons was Winston's fellow-employee at the Minis-try of Truth. He was a fattish but active man of paralysingstupidity, a mass of imbecile enthusiasms—one of thosecompletely unquestioning, devoted drudges on whom,more even than on the Thought Police, the stability of theParty depended. At thirty-five he had just been unwilling-ly evicted from the Youth League, and before graduatinginto the Youth League he had managed to stay on in theSpies for a year beyond the statutory age. At the Ministryhe was employed in some subordinate post for which in-telligence was not required, but on the other hand he wasa leading figure on the Sports Committee and all the othercommittees engaged in organizing community hikes, spon-taneous demonstrations, savings campaigns, and voluntaryactivities generally. He would inform you with quiet pride,between whiffs of his pipe, that he had put in an appearanceat the Community Centre every evening for the past fouryears. An overpowering smell of sweat, a sort of uncon-scious testimony to the strenuousness of his life, followed

1984

him about wherever he went, and even remained behindhim after he had gone.

'Have you got a spanner?' said Winston, fiddling with thenut on the angle-joint.

'A spanner,' said Mrs Parsons, immediately becominginvertebrate. 'I don't know, I'm sure. Perhaps the children—

There was a trampling of boots and another blast on thecomb as the children charged into the living-room. MrsParsons brought the spanner. Winston let out the waterand disgustedly removed the clot of human hair that hadblocked up the pipe. He cleaned his fingers as best he couldin the cold water from the tap and went back into the otherroom.

'Up with your hands!' yelled a savage voice.

A handsome, tough-looking boy of nine had popped upfrom behind the table and was menacing him with a toyautomatic pistol, while his small sister, about two yearsyounger, made the same gesture with a fragment of wood.Both of them were dressed in the blue shorts, grey shirts,and red neckerchiefs which were the uniform of the Spies.Winston raised his hands above his head, but with an un-easy feeling, so vicious was the boy's demeanour, that it wasnot altogether a game.

'You're a traitor!' yelled the boy. 'You're a thought-crimi-nal! You're a Eurasian spy! I'll shoot you, I'll vaporize you,I'll send you to the salt mines!'

Suddenly they were both leaping round him, shouting'Traitor!' and 'Thought-criminal!' the little girl imitating

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 29

her brother in every movement. It was somehow slightlyfrightening, like the gambolling of tiger cubs which willsoon grow up into man-eaters. There was a sort of calculat-ing ferocity in the boy's eye, a quite evident desire to hit orkick Winston and a consciousness of being very nearly bigenough to do so. It was a good job it was not a real pistol hewas holding, Winston thought.

Mrs Parsons' eyes flitted nervously from Winston to thechildren, and back again. In the better light of the living-room he noticed with interest that there actually was dustin the creases of her face.

"They do get so noisy' she said. 'They're disappointedbecause they couldn't go to see the hanging, that's what itis. I'm too busy to take them, and Tom won't be back fromwork in time.'

'Why can't we go and see the hanging?' roared the boy inhis huge voice.

'Want to see the hanging! Want to see the hanging!'chanted the little girl, still capering round.

Some Eurasian prisoners, guilty of war crimes, were tobe hanged in the Park that evening, Winston remembered.This happened about once a month, and was a popular spec-tacle. Children always clamoured to be taken to see it. Hetook his leave of Mrs Parsons and made for the door. But hehad not gone six steps down the passage when somethinghit the back of his neck an agonizingly painful blow. It wasas though a red-hot wire had been jabbed into him. He spunround just in time to see Mrs Parsons dragging her son backinto the doorway while the boy pocketed a catapult.

1984

'Goldstein!' bellowed the boy as the door closed on him.But what most struck Winston was the look of helplessfright on the woman's greyish face.

Back in the flat he stepped quickly past the telescreenand sat down at the table again, still rubbing his neck. Themusic from the telescreen had stopped. Instead, a clippedmilitary voice was reading out, with a sort of brutal relish,a description of the armaments of the new Floating For-tress which had just been anchored between Iceland andthe Faroe Islands.

With those children, he thought, that wretched wom-an must lead a life of terror. Another year, two years, andthey would be watching her night and day for symptoms ofunorthodoxy Nearly all children nowadays were horrible.What was worst of all was that by means of such organi-zations as the Spies they were systematically turned intoungovernable little savages, and yet this produced in themno tendency whatever to rebel against the discipline of theParty. On the contrary, they adored the Party and every-thing connected with it. The songs, the processions, thebanners, the hiking, the drilling with dummy rifles, theyelling of slogans, the worship of Big Brother—it was all asort of glorious game to them. All their ferocity was turnedoutwards, against the enemies of the State, against foreign-ers, traitors, saboteurs, thought-criminals. It was almostnormal for people over thirty to be frightened of their ownchildren. And with good reason, for hardly a week passedin which 'The Times' did not carry a paragraph describinghow some eavesdropping little sneak—'child hero' was the

phrase generally used—had overheard some compromisingremark and denounced its parents to the Thought Police.

The sting of the catapult bullet had worn off. He pickedup his pen half-heartedly, wondering whether he could findsomething more to write in the diary. Suddenly he beganthinking of O'Brien again.

Years ago—how long was it? Seven years it must be—hehad dreamed that he was walking through a pitch-darkroom. And someone sitting to one side of him had said ashe passed: 'We shall meet in the place where there is nodarkness.' It was said very quietly, almost casually—a state-ment, not a command. He had walked on without pausing.What was curious was that at the time, in the dream, thewords had not made much impression on him. It was onlylater and by degrees that they had seemed to take on signifi-cance. He could not now remember whether it was beforeor after having the dream that he had seen O'Brien for thefirst time, nor could he remember when he had first identi-fied the voice as O'Brien's. But at any rate the identificationexisted. It was O'Brien who had spoken to him out of thedark.

Winston had never been able to feel sure—even after thismorning's flash of the eyes it was still impossible to be surewhether O'Brien was a friend or an enemy. Nor did it evenseem to matter greatly. There was a link of understandingbetween them, more important than affection or partisan-ship. 'We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,'he had said. Winston did not know what it meant, only thatin some way or another it would come true.

1984

The voice from the telescreen paused. A trumpet call,clear and beautiful, floated into the stagnant air. The voicecontinued raspingly:

'Attention! Your attention, please! A newsflash has thismoment arrived from the Malabar front. Our forces in SouthIndia have won a glorious victory. I am authorized to saythat the action we are now reporting may well bring the warwithin measurable distance of its end. Here is the newsflash—

Bad news coming, thought Winston. And sure enough,following on a gory description of the annihilation of aEurasian army, with stupendous figures of killed and pris-oners, came the announcement that, as from next week, thechocolate ration would be reduced from thirty grammes totwenty.

Winston belched again. The gin was wearing off, leavinga deflated feeling. The telescreen—perhaps to celebrate thevictory, perhaps to drown the memory of the lost chocolate—crashed into 'Oceania, 'tis for thee'. You were supposed tostand to attention. However, in his present position he wasinvisible.

'Oceania, 'tis for thee' gave way to lighter music. Win-ston walked over to the window, keeping his back to thetelescreen. The day was still cold and clear. Somewhere faraway a rocket bomb exploded with a dull, reverberatingroar. About twenty or thirty of them a week were falling onLondon at present.

Down in the street the wind flapped the torn poster toand fro, and the word INGSOC fitfully appeared and van-ished. Ingsoc. The sacred principles of Ingsoc. Newspeak,doublethink, the mutability of the past. He felt as thoughhe were wandering in the forests of the sea bottom, lost ina monstrous world where he himself was the monster. Hewas alone. The past was dead, the future was unimaginable.What certainty had he that a single human creature nowliving was on his side? And what way of knowing that thedominion of the Party would not endure FOR EVER? Likean answer, the three slogans on the white face of the Minis-try of Truth came back to him:

WAR IS PEACE

FREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH

He took a twenty-five cent piece out of his pocket. There,too, in tiny clear lettering, the same slogans were inscribed,and on the other face of the coin the head of Big Broth-er. Even from the coin the eyes pursued you. On coins, onstamps, on the covers of books, on banners, on posters, andon the wrappings of a cigarette packet—everywhere. Al-ways the eyes watching you and the voice enveloping you.Asleep or awake, working or eating, indoors or out of doors,in the bath or in bed—no escape. Nothing was your own ex-cept the few cubic centimetres inside your skull.

The sun had shifted round, and the myriad windows ofthe Ministry of Truth, with the light no longer shining on

1984

them, looked grim as the loopholes of a fortress. His heartquailed before the enormous pyramidal shape. It was toostrong, it could not be stormed. A thousand rocket bombswould not batter it down. He wondered again for whom hewas writing the diary. For the future, for the past—for anage that might be imaginary. And in front of him there laynot death but annihilation. The diary would be reducedto ashes and himself to vapour. Only the Thought Policewould read what he had written, before they wiped it out ofexistence and out of memory. How could you make appealto the future when not a trace of you, not even an anony-mous word scribbled on a piece of paper, could physicallysurvive?

The telescreen struck fourteen. He must leave in ten min-utes. He had to be back at work by fourteen-thirty

Curiously, the chiming of the hour seemed to have putnew heart into him. He was a lonely ghost uttering a truththat nobody would ever hear. But so long as he uttered it,in some obscure way the continuity was not broken. It wasnot by making yourself heard but by staying sane that youcarried on the human heritage. He went back to the table,dipped his pen, and wrote:

To the future or to the past, to a time when thought isfree, when men are different from one another and do notlive alone—to a time when truth exists and what is donecannot be undone: From the age of uniformity, from theage of solitude, from the age of Big Brother, from the age ofdoublethink—greetings!

He was already dead, he reflected. It seemed to him thatit was only now, when he had begun to be able to formulatehis thoughts, that he had taken the decisive step. The conse-quences of every act are included in the act itself. He wrote:

Thoughtcrime does not entail death: thoughtcrime IS death.

Now he had recognized himself as a dead man it becameimportant to stay alive as long as possible. Two fingers of hisright hand were inkstained. It was exactly the kind of detailthat might betray you. Some nosing zealot in the Ministry(a woman, probably: someone like the little sandy-hairedwoman or the dark-haired girl from the Fiction Depart-ment) might start wondering why he had been writingduring the lunch interval, why he had used an old-fash-ioned pen, WHAT he had been writing—and then drop ahint in the appropriate quarter. He went to the bathroomand carefully scrubbed the ink away with the gritty dark-brown soap which rasped your skin like sandpaper and wastherefore well adapted for this purpose.

He put the diary away in the drawer. It was quite uselessto think of hiding it, but he could at least make sure whetheror not its existence had been discovered. A hair laid acrossthe page-ends was too obvious. With the tip of his finger hepicked up an identifiable grain of whitish dust and depos-ited it on the corner of the cover, where it was bound to beshaken off if the book was moved.

Chapter 3

Winston was dreaming of his mother.He must, he thought, have been ten or elev-en years old when his mother had disappeared. She wasa tall, statuesque, rather silent woman with slow move-ments and magnificent fair hair. His father he rememberedmore vaguely as dark and thin, dressed always in neat darkclothes (Winston remembered especially the very thin solesof his father's shoes) and wearing spectacles. The two ofthem must evidently have been swallowed up in one of thefirst great purges of the fifties.

At this moment his mother was sitting in some placedeep down beneath him, with his young sister in her arms.He did not remember his sister at all, except as a tiny, feeblebaby, always silent, with large, watchful eyes. Both of themwere looking up at him. They were down in some subter-ranean place—the bottom of a well, for instance, or a verydeep grave—but it was a place which, already far below him,was itself moving downwards. They were in the saloon ofa sinking ship, looking up at him through the darkeningwater. There was still air in the saloon, they could still seehim and he them, but all the while they were sinking down,down into the green waters which in another moment musthide them from sight for ever. He was out in the light andair while they were being sucked down to death, and they

were down there because he was up here. He knew it andthey knew it, and he could see the knowledge in their faces.There was no reproach either in their faces or in their hearts,only the knowledge that they must die in order that hemight remain alive, and that this was part of the unavoid-able order of things.

He could not remember what had happened, but he knewin his dream that in some way the lives of his mother andhis sister had been sacrificed to his own. It was one of thosedreams which, while retaining the characteristic dreamscenery, are a continuation of one's intellectual life, andin which one becomes aware of facts and ideas which stillseem new and valuable after one is awake. The thing thatnow suddenly struck Winston was that his mother's death,nearly thirty years ago, had been tragic and sorrowful in away that was no longer possible. Tragedy, he perceived, be-longed to the ancient time, to a time when there was stillprivacy, love, and friendship, and when the members of afamily stood by one another without needing to know thereason. His mother's memory tore at his heart because shehad died loving him, when he was too young and selfishto love her in return, and because somehow, he did not re-member how, she had sacrificed herself to a conception ofloyalty that was private and unalterable. Such things, hesaw, could not happen today. Today there were fear, hatred,and pain, but no dignity of emotion, no deep or complexsorrows. All this he seemed to see in the large eyes of hismother and his sister, looking up at him through the greenwater, hundreds of fathoms down and still sinking.

38 1984

Suddenly he was standing on short springy turf, on asummer evening when the slanting rays of the sun gildedthe ground. The landscape that he was looking at recurredso often in his dreams that he was never fully certainwhether or not he had seen it in the real world. In his wak-ing thoughts he called it the Golden Country. It was an old,rabbit-bitten pasture, with a foot-track wandering across itand a molehill here and there. In the ragged hedge on theopposite side of the field the boughs of the elm trees wereswaying very faintly in the breeze, their leaves just stirringin dense masses like women's hair. Somewhere near at hand,though out of sight, there was a clear, slow-moving streamwhere dace were swimming in the pools under the willowtrees.

The girl with dark hair was coming towards them acrossthe field. With what seemed a single movement she tore offher clothes and flung them disdainfully aside. Her bodywas white and smooth, but it aroused no desire in him, in-deed he barely looked at it. What overwhelmed him in thatinstant was admiration for the gesture with which she hadthrown her clothes aside. With its grace and carelessnessit seemed to annihilate a whole culture, a whole systemof thought, as though Big Brother and the Party and theThought Police could all be swept into nothingness by a sin-gle splendid movement of the arm. That too was a gesturebelonging to the ancient time. Winston woke up with theword 'Shakespeare' on his lips.

The telescreen was giving forth an ear-splitting whistlewhich continued on the same note for thirty seconds. It

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 39

was nought seven fifteen, getting-up time for office workers.Winston wrenched his body out of bed—naked, for a mem-ber of the Outer Party received only 3,000 clothing couponsannually, and a suit of pyjamas was 600—and seized a din-gy singlet and a pair of shorts that were lying across a chair.The Physical Jerks would begin in three minutes. The nextmoment he was doubled up by a violent coughing fit whichnearly always attacked him soon after waking up. It emptiedhis lungs so completely that he could only begin breathingagain by lying on his back and taking a series of deep gasps.His veins had swelled with the effort of the cough, and thevaricose ulcer had started itching.

'Thirty to forty group!' yapped a piercing female voice.'Thirty to forty group! Take your places, please. Thirties toforties!'

Winston sprang to attention in front of the telescreen,upon which the image of a youngish woman, scrawny butmuscular, dressed in tunic and gym-shoes, had already ap-peared.

'Arms bending and stretching!' she rapped out. 'Takeyour time by me. ONE, two, three, four! ONE, two, three,four! Come on, comrades, put a bit of life into it! ONE, two,three four! ONE two, three, four!...'

The pain of the coughing fit had not quite driven out ofWinston's mind the impression made by his dream, and therhythmic movements of the exercise restored it somewhat.As he mechanically shot his arms back and forth, wearingon his face the look of grim enjoyment which was consid-ered proper during the Physical Jerks, he was struggling

1984

to think his way backward into the dim period of his earlychildhood. It was extraordinarily difficult. Beyond the latefifties everything faded. When there were no external re-cords that you could refer to, even the outline of your ownlife lost its sharpness. You remembered huge events whichhad quite probably not happened, you remembered thedetail of incidents without being able to recapture their at-mosphere, and there were long blank periods to which youcould assign nothing. Everything had been different then.Even the names of countries, and their shapes on the map,had been different. Airstrip One, for instance, had not beenso called in those days: it had been called England or Brit-ain, though London, he felt fairly certain, had always beencalled London.

Winston could not definitely remember a time when hiscountry had not been at war, but it was evident that therehad been a fairly long interval of peace during his child-hood, because one of his early memories was of an air raidwhich appeared to take everyone by surprise. Perhaps it wasthe time when the atomic bomb had fallen on Colchester.He did not remember the raid itself, but he did rememberhis father's hand clutching his own as they hurried down,down, down into some place deep in the earth, round andround a spiral staircase which rang under his feet and whichfinally so wearied his legs that he began whimpering andthey had to stop and rest. His mother, in her slow, dreamyway, was following a long way behind them. She was car-rying his baby sister—or perhaps it was only a bundle ofblankets that she was carrying: he was not certain whether

his sister had been born then. Finally they had emerged intoa noisy, crowded place which he had realized to be a Tubestation.

There were people sitting all over the stone-flagged floor,and other people, packed tightly together, were sitting onmetal bunks, one above the other. Winston and his motherand father found themselves a place on the floor, and nearthem an old man and an old woman were sitting side byside on a bunk. The old man had on a decent dark suit anda black cloth cap pushed back from very white hair: hisface was scarlet and his eyes were blue and full of tears. Hereeked of gin. It seemed to breathe out of his skin in placeof sweat, and one could have fancied that the tears wellingfrom his eyes were pure gin. But though slightly drunk hewas also suffering under some grief that was genuine andunbearable. In his childish way Winston grasped that someterrible thing, something that was beyond forgiveness andcould never be remedied, had just happened. It also seemedto him that he knew what it was. Someone whom the oldman loved—a little granddaughter, perhaps—had beenkilled. Every few minutes the old man kept repeating:

'We didn't ought to 'ave trusted 'em. I said so, Ma, didn't I?That's what comes of trusting 'em. I said so all along. Wedidn't ought to 'ave trusted the buggers'

But which buggers they didn't ought to have trustedWinston could not now remember.

Since about that time, war had been literally continu-

1984

ous, though strictly speaking it had not always been thesame war. For several months during his childhood therehad been confused street fighting in London itself, some ofwhich he remembered vividly But to trace out the historyof the whole period, to say who was fighting whom at anygiven moment, would have been utterly impossible, sinceno written record, and no spoken word, ever made mentionof any other alignment than the existing one. At this mo-ment, for example, in 1984 (if it was 1984), Oceania was atwar with Eurasia and in alliance with Eastasia. In no pub-lic or private utterance was it ever admitted that the threepowers had at any time been grouped along different lines.Actually, as Winston well knew, it was only four years sinceOceania had been at war with Eastasia and in alliance withEurasia. But that was merely a piece of furtive knowledgewhich he happened to possess because his memory was notsatisfactorily under control. Officially the change of part-ners had never happened. Oceania was at war with Eurasia:therefore Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia. Theenemy of the moment always represented absolute evil, andit followed that any past or future agreement with him wasimpossible.

The frightening thing, he reflected for the ten thou-sandth time as he forced his shoulders painfully backward(with hands on hips, they were gyrating their bodies fromthe waist, an exercise that was supposed to be good for theback muscles)—the frightening thing was that it might allbe true. If the Party could thrust its hand into the past andsay of this or that event, IT NEVER HAPPENED—that,

Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com

surely, was more terrifying than mere torture and death?

The Party said that Oceania had never been in alliancewith Eurasia. He, Winston Smith, knew that Oceania hadbeen in alliance with Eurasia as short a time as four yearsago. But where did that knowledge exist? Only in his ownconsciousness, which in any case must soon be annihilated.And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed—if all records told the same tale—then the lie passed intohistory and became truth. 'Who controls the past,' ran theParty slogan, 'controls the future: who controls the presentcontrols the past.' And yet the past, though of its nature al-terable, never had been altered. Whatever was true now wastrue from everlasting to everlasting. It was quite simple. Allthat was needed was an unending series of victories overyour own memory. 'Reality control', they called it: in New-speak, 'doublethink'.

'Stand easy!' barked the instructress, a little more genial-

iy-

Winston sank his arms to his sides and slowly refilledhis lungs with air. His mind slid away into the labyrin-thine world of doublethink. To know and not to know, tobe conscious of complete truthfulness while telling care-fully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinionswhich cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictoryand believing in both of them, to use logic against logic,to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believethat democracy was impossible and that the Party was theguardian of democracy, to forget whatever it was necessaryto forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the

1984

moment when it was needed, and then promptly to forgetit again: and above all, to apply the same process to the pro-cess itself. That was the ultimate subtlety: consciously toinduce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to becomeunconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed.Even to understand the word 'doublethink' involved theuse of doublethink.

The instructress had called them to attention again. 'Andnow let's see which of us can touch our toes!' she said en-thusiastically. 'Right over from the hips, please, comrades.ONE-two! ONE-two!...'

Winston loathed this exercise, which sent shooting painsall the way from his heels to his buttocks and often ended bybringing on another coughing fit. The half-pleasant qual-ity went out of his meditations. The past, he reflected, hadnot merely been altered, it had been actually destroyed. Forhow could you establish even the most obvious fact whenthere existed no record outside your own memory? He triedto remember in what year he had first heard mention ofBig Brother. He thought it must have been at some time inthe sixties, but it was impossible to be certain. In the Partyhistories, of course, Big Brother figured as the leader andguardian of the Revolution since its very earliest days. Hisexploits had been gradually pushed backwards in time untilalready they extended into the fabulous world of the fortiesand the thirties, when the capitalists in their strange cylin-drical hats still rode through the streets of London in greatgleaming motor-cars or horse carriages with glass sides.There was no knowing how much of this legend was true

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 45

and how much invented. Winston could not even remem-ber at what date the Party itself had come into existence. Hedid not believe he had ever heard the word Ingsoc before1960, but it was possible that in its Oldspeak form—'Eng-lish Socialism', that is to say—it had been current earlier.Everything melted into mist. Sometimes, indeed, you couldput your finger on a definite lie. It was not true, for example,as was claimed in the Party history books, that the Partyhad invented aeroplanes. He remembered aeroplanes sincehis earliest childhood. But you could prove nothing. Therewas never any evidence. Just once in his whole life he hadheld in his hands unmistakable documentary proof of thefalsification of an historical fact. And on that occasion

'Smith!' screamed the shrewish voice from the telescreen.'6079 Smith W.! Yes, YOU! Bend lower, please! You can dobetter than that. You're not trying. Lower, please! THAT'Sbetter, comrade. Now stand at ease, the whole squad, andwatch me.'

A sudden hot sweat had broken out all over Winston'sbody. His face remained completely inscrutable. Nev-er show dismay! Never show resentment! A single flickerof the eyes could give you away. He stood watching whilethe instructress raised her arms above her head and—onecould not say gracefully, but with remarkable neatness andefficiency—bent over and tucked the first joint of her fin-gers under her toes.

'THERE, comrades! THAT'S how I want to see you do-ing it. Watch me again. I'm thirty-nine and I've had fourchildren. Now look.' She bent over again. 'You see MY

We don't all havethe privilege of fighting in the front line, but at least we canall keep fit. Remember our boys on the Malabar front! Andthe sailors in the Floating Fortresses! Just think what THEYhave to put up with. Now try again. That's better, comrade,that's MUCH better,' she added encouragingly as Winston,with a violent lunge, succeeded in touching his toes withknees unbent, for the first time in several years.

Chapter 4

With the deep, unconscious sigh which not even thenearness of the telescreen could prevent him fromuttering when his day's work started, Winston pulled thespeakwrite towards him, blew the dust from its mouthpiece,and put on his spectacles. Then he unrolled and clippedtogether four small cylinders of paper which had alreadyflopped out of the pneumatic tube on the right-hand sideof his desk.

In the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices. Tothe right of the speakwrite, a small pneumatic tube for writ-ten messages, to the left, a larger one for newspapers; and inthe side wall, within easy reach of Winston's arm, a largeoblong slit protected by a wire grating. This last was for thedisposal of waste paper. Similar slits existed in thousands ortens of thousands throughout the building, not only in ev-ery room but at short intervals in every corridor. For somereason they were nicknamed memory holes. When oneknew that any document was due for destruction, or evenwhen one saw a scrap of waste paper lying about, it was anautomatic action to lift the flap of the nearest memory holeand drop it in, whereupon it would be whirled away on acurrent of warm air to the enormous furnaces which werehidden somewhere in the recesses of the building.

Winston examined the four slips of paper which he had

1984

unrolled. Each contained a message of only one or two lines,in the abbreviated jargon—not actually Newspeak, but con-sisting largely of Newspeak words—which was used in theMinistry for internal purposes. They ran:

times 17.3.84 bb speech malreported africa rectify

times 19.12.83 forecasts 3 yp 4th quarter 83 misprints verify

current issue

times 14.2.84 miniplenty malquoted chocolate rectify

times 3.12.83 reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refsunpersons rewritefullwise upsub antefiling

With a faint feeling of satisfaction Winston laid thefourth message aside. It was an intricate and responsible joband had better be dealt with last. The other three were rou-tine matters, though the second one would probably meansome tedious wading through lists of figures.

Winston dialled 'back numbers' on the telescreen andcalled for the appropriate issues of 'The Times', which slidout of the pneumatic tube after only a few minutes' delay.The messages he had received referred to articles or newsitems which for one reason or another it was thought neces-sary to alter, or, as the official phrase had it, to rectify. Forexample, it appeared from 'The Times' of the seventeenthof March that Big Brother, in his speech of the previousday, had predicted that the South Indian front would re-main quiet but that a Eurasian offensive would shortly be

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 49

launched in North Africa. As it happened, the EurasianHigher Command had launched its offensive in South In-dia and left North Africa alone. It was therefore necessaryto rewrite a paragraph of Big Brother's speech, in such away as to make him predict the thing that had actually hap-pened. Or again, "The Times' of the nineteenth of Decemberhad published the official forecasts of the output of variousclasses of consumption goods in the fourth quarter of 1983,which was also the sixth quarter of the Ninth Three-YearPlan. Today's issue contained a statement of the actual out-put, from which it appeared that the forecasts were in everyinstance grossly wrong. Winston's job was to rectify theoriginal figures by making them agree with the later ones.As for the third message, it referred to a very simple errorwhich could be set right in a couple of minutes. As short atime ago as February, the Ministry of Plenty had issued apromise (a 'categorical pledge' were the official words) thatthere would be no reduction of the chocolate ration during1984. Actually, as Winston was aware, the chocolate rationwas to be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty at the endof the present week. All that was needed was to substitutefor the original promise a warning that it would probablybe necessary to reduce the ration at some time in April.

As soon as Winston had dealt with each of the messages,he clipped his speakwritten corrections to the appropriatecopy of "The Times' and pushed them into the pneumatictube. Then, with a movement which was as nearly as possi-ble unconscious, he crumpled up the original message andany notes that he himself had made, and dropped them into

1984

the memory hole to be devoured by the flames.

What happened in the unseen labyrinth to which thepneumatic tubes led, he did not know in detail, but he didknow in general terms. As soon as all the corrections whichhappened to be necessary in any particular number of 'TheTimes' had been assembled and collated, that number wouldbe reprinted, the original copy destroyed, and the correctedcopy placed on the files in its stead. This process of con-tinuous alteration was applied not only to newspapers, butto books, periodicals, pamphlets, posters, leaflets, films,sound-tracks, cartoons, photographs—to every kind of lit-erature or documentation which might conceivably holdany political or ideological significance. Day by day andalmost minute by minute the past was brought up to date.In this way every prediction made by the Party could beshown by documentary evidence to have been correct, norwas any item of news, or any expression of opinion, whichconflicted with the needs of the moment, ever allowed toremain on record. All history was a palimpsest, scrapedclean and reinscribed exactly as often as was necessary. Inno case would it have been possible, once the deed was done,to prove that any falsification had taken place. The largestsection of the Records Department, far larger than the oneon which Winston worked, consisted simply of personswhose duty it was to track down and collect all copies ofbooks, newspapers, and other documents which had beensuperseded and were due for destruction. A number of'TheTimes' which might, because of changes in political align-ment, or mistaken prophecies uttered by Big Brother, have

been rewritten a dozen times still stood on the files bearingits original date, and no other copy existed to contradict it.Books, also, were recalled and rewritten again and again,and were invariably reissued without any admission thatany alteration had been made. Even the written instruc-tions which Winston received, and which he invariably gotrid of as soon as he had dealt with them, never stated orimplied that an act of forgery was to be committed: alwaysthe reference was to slips, errors, misprints, or misquota-tions which it was necessary to put right in the interests ofaccuracy.

But actually, he thought as he re-adjusted the Ministryof Plenty's figures, it was not even forgery. It was merely thesubstitution of one piece of nonsense for another. Most ofthe material that you were dealing with had no connexionwith anything in the real world, not even the kind of con-nexion that is contained in a direct lie. Statistics were justas much a fantasy in their original version as in their recti-fied version. A great deal of the time you were expected tomake them up out of your head. For example, the Minis-try of Plenty's forecast had estimated the output of bootsfor the quarter at 145 million pairs. The actual output wasgiven as sixty-two millions. Winston, however, in rewritingthe forecast, marked the figure down to fifty-seven millions,so as to allow for the usual claim that the quota had beenoverfulfilled. In any case, sixty-two millions was no near-er the truth than fifty-seven millions, or than 145 millions.Very likely no boots had been produced at all. Likelier still,nobody knew how many had been produced, much less

1984

cared. All one knew was that every quarter astronomicalnumbers of boots were produced on paper, while perhapshalf the population of Oceania went barefoot. And so it waswith every class of recorded fact, great or small. Everythingfaded away into a shadow-world in which, finally, even thedate of the year had become uncertain.

Winston glanced across the hall. In the correspondingcubicle on the other side a small, precise-looking, dark-chinned man named Tillotson was working steadily away,with a folded newspaper on his knee and his mouth veryclose to the mouthpiece of the speakwrite. He had the air oftrying to keep what he was saying a secret between himselfand the telescreen. He looked up, and his spectacles darteda hostile flash in Winston's direction.

Winston hardly knew Tillotson, and had no idea whatwork he was employed on. People in the Records Depart-ment did not readily talk about their jobs. In the long,windowless hall, with its double row of cubicles and its end-less rustle of papers and hum of voices murmuring intospeakwrites, there were quite a dozen people whom Win-ston did not even know by name, though he daily saw themhurrying to and fro in the corridors or gesticulating in theTwo Minutes Hate. He knew that in the cubicle next to himthe little woman with sandy hair toiled day in day out, sim-ply at tracking down and deleting from the Press the namesof people who had been vaporized and were therefore con-sidered never to have existed. There was a certain fitness inthis, since her own husband had been vaporized a coupleof years earlier. And a few cubicles away a mild, ineffec-

tual, dreamy creature named Ampleforth, with very hairyears and a surprising talent for juggling with rhymes andmetres, was engaged in producing garbled versions—defin-itive texts, they were called—of poems which had becomeideologically offensive, but which for one reason or anotherwere to be retained in the anthologies. And this hall, withits fifty workers or thereabouts, was only one sub-section, asingle cell, as it were, in the huge complexity of the RecordsDepartment. Beyond, above, below, were other swarmsof workers engaged in an unimaginable multitude of jobs.There were the huge printing-shops with their sub-editors,their typography experts, and their elaborately equippedstudios for the faking of photographs. There was the tele-programmes section with its engineers, its producers, andits teams of actors specially chosen for their skill in imitat-ing voices. There were the armies of reference clerks whosejob was simply to draw up lists of books and periodicalswhich were due for recall. There were the vast repositorieswhere the corrected documents were stored, and the hid-den furnaces where the original copies were destroyed. Andsomewhere or other, quite anonymous, there were the di-recting brains who co-ordinated the whole effort and laiddown the lines of policy which made it necessary that thisfragment of the past should be preserved, that one falsified,and the other rubbed out of existence.

And the Records Department, after all, was itself only asingle branch of the Ministry of Truth, whose primary jobwas not to reconstruct the past but to supply the citizensof Oceania with newspapers, films, textbooks, telescreen

1984

programmes, plays, novels—with every conceivable kind ofinformation, instruction, or entertainment, from a statue toa slogan, from a lyric poem to a biological treatise, and froma child's spelling-book to a Newspeak dictionary. And theMinistry had not only to supply the multifarious needs ofthe party, but also to repeat the whole operation at a lowerlevel for the benefit of the proletariat. There was a wholechain of separate departments dealing with proletarian lit-erature, music, drama, and entertainment generally. Herewere produced rubbishy newspapers containing almostnothing except sport, crime and astrology, sensationalfive-cent novelettes, films oozing with sex, and sentimen-tal songs which were composed entirely by mechanicalmeans on a special kind of kaleidoscope known as a ver-sificator. There was even a whole sub-section—Pornosec, itwas called in Newspeak—engaged in producing the lowestkind of pornography, which was sent out in sealed packetsand which no Party member, other than those who workedon it, was permitted to look at.

Three messages had slid out of the pneumatic tube whileWinston was working, but they were simple matters, andhe had disposed of them before the Two Minutes Hate in-terrupted him. When the Hate was over he returned tohis cubicle, took the Newspeak dictionary from the shelf,pushed the speakwrite to one side, cleaned his spectacles,and settled down to his main job of the morning.

Winston's greatest pleasure in life was in his work. Mostof it was a tedious routine, but included in it there were alsojobs so difficult and intricate that you could lose yourself in

them as in the depths of a mathematical problem—delicatepieces of forgery in which you had nothing to guide youexcept your knowledge of the principles of Ingsoc and yourestimate of what the Party wanted you to say Winston wasgood at this kind of thing. On occasion he had even beenentrusted with the rectification of "The Times' leading arti-cles, which were written entirely in Newspeak. He unrolledthe message that he had set aside earlier. It ran:

times 3.12.83 reportingbb dayorder doubleplusungood refsunpersons rewrite fullwise upsub antefiling

In Oldspeak (or standard English) this might be ren-dered:

The reporting of Big Brother's Order for the Day in 'The Times'of December 3rd 1983 is extremely unsatisfactory and makesreferences to non-existent persons. Rewrite it in full andsubmit your draft to higher authority before filing.

Winston read through the offending article. Big Broth-er's Order for the Day, it seemed, had been chiefly devotedto praising the work of an organization known as FFCC,which supplied cigarettes and other comforts to the sailorsin the Floating Fortresses. A certain Comrade Withers, aprominent member of the Inner Party, had been singled outfor special mention and awarded a decoration, the Order ofConspicuous Merit, Second Class.

Three months later FFCC had suddenly been dissolved

1984

with no reasons given. One could assume that Withers andhis associates were now in disgrace, but there had been noreport of the matter in the Press or on the telescreen. Thatwas to be expected, since it was unusual for political offend-ers to be put on trial or even publicly denounced. The greatpurges involving thousands of people, with public trials oftraitors and thought-criminals who made abject confessionof their crimes and were afterwards executed, were specialshow-pieces not occurring oftener than once in a couple ofyears. More commonly, people who had incurred the dis-pleasure of the Party simply disappeared and were neverheard of again. One never had the smallest clue as to whathad happened to them. In some cases they might not evenbe dead. Perhaps thirty people personally known to Win-ston, not counting his parents, had disappeared at one timeor another.

Winston stroked his nose gently with a paper-clip. In thecubicle across the way Comrade Tillotson was still crouch-ing secretively over his speakwrite. He raised his head fora moment: again the hostile spectacle-flash. Winston won-dered whether Comrade Tillotson was engaged on the samejob as himself. It was perfectly possible. So tricky a piece ofwork would never be entrusted to a single person: on theother hand, to turn it over to a committee would be to ad-mit openly that an act of fabrication was taking place. Verylikely as many as a dozen people were now working awayon rival versions of what Big Brother had actually said. Andpresently some master brain in the Inner Party would se-lect this version or that, would re-edit it and set in motion

the complex processes of cross-referencing that would berequired, and then the chosen lie would pass into the per-manent records and become truth.

Winston did not know why Withers had been disgraced.Perhaps it was for corruption or incompetence. Perhaps BigBrother was merely getting rid of a too-popular subordi-nate. Perhaps Withers or someone close to him had beensuspected of heretical tendencies. Or perhaps—what waslikeliest of all—the thing had simply happened becausepurges and vaporizations were a necessary part of the me-chanics of government. The only real clue lay in the words'refs unpersons', which indicated that Withers was alreadydead. You could not invariably assume this to be the casewhen people were arrested. Sometimes they were releasedand allowed to remain at liberty for as much as a year ortwo years before being executed. Very occasionally someperson whom you had believed dead long since would makea ghostly reappearance at some public trial where he wouldimplicate hundreds of others by his testimony before van-ishing, this time for ever. Withers, however, was already anUNPERSON. He did not exist: he had never existed. Win-ston decided that it would not be enough simply to reversethe tendency of Big Brother's speech. It was better to makeit deal with something totally unconnected with its origi-nal subject.

He might turn the speech into the usual denunciation oftraitors and thought-criminals, but that was a little too ob-vious, while to invent a victory at the front, or some triumphof over-production in the Ninth Three-Year Plan, might

1984

complicate the records too much. What was needed was apiece of pure fantasy. Suddenly there sprang into his mind,ready made as it were, the image of a certain Comrade Ogil-vy, who had recently died in battle, in heroic circumstances.There were occasions when Big Brother devoted his Orderfor the Day to commemorating some humble, rank-and-fileParty member whose life and death he held up as an exam-ple worthy to be followed. Today he should commemorateComrade Ogilvy. It was true that there was no such personas Comrade Ogilvy, but a few lines of print and a couple offaked photographs would soon bring him into existence.

Winston thought for a moment, then pulled the speak-write towards him and began dictating in Big Brother'sfamiliar style: a style at once military and pedantic, and,because of a trick of asking questions and then promptlyanswering them ('What lessons do we learn from this fact,comrades? The lesson—which is also one of the fundamen-tal principles of Ingsoc—that,' etc., etc.), easy to imitate.

At the age of three Comrade Ogilvy had refused all toysexcept a drum, a sub-machine gun, and a model helicopter.At six—a year early, by a special relaxation of the rules—hehad joined the Spies, at nine he had been a troop leader. Ateleven he had denounced his uncle to the Thought Policeafter overhearing a conversation which appeared to him tohave criminal tendencies. At seventeen he had been a dis-trict organizer of the Junior Anti-Sex League. At nineteenhe had designed a hand-grenade which had been adoptedby the Ministry of Peace and which, at its first trial, hadkilled thirty-one Eurasian prisoners in one burst. At twen-

ty-three he had perished in action. Pursued by enemy jetplanes while flying over the Indian Ocean with importantdespatches, he had weighted his body with his machine gunand leapt out of the helicopter into deep water, despatchesand all—an end, said Big Brother, which it was impossibleto contemplate without feelings of envy. Big Brother added afew remarks on the purity and single-mindedness of Com-rade Ogilvy's life. He was a total abstainer and a nonsmoker,had no recreations except a daily hour in the gymnasium,and had taken a vow of celibacy, believing marriage and thecare of a family to be incompatible with a twenty-four-hour-a-day devotion to duty. He had no subjects of conversationexcept the principles of Ingsoc, and no aim in life exceptthe defeat of the Eurasian enemy and the hunting-down ofspies, saboteurs, thoughtcriminals, and traitors generally.

Winston debated with himself whether to award Com-rade Ogilvy the Order of Conspicuous Merit: in the end hedecided against it because of the unnecessary cross-refer-encing that it would entail.

Once again he glanced at his rival in the opposite cubicle.Something seemed to tell him with certainty that Tillotsonwas busy on the same job as himself. There was no way ofknowing whose job would finally be adopted, but he felt aprofound conviction that it would be his own. ComradeOgilvy, unimagined an hour ago, was now a fact. It struckhim as curious that you could create dead men but not liv-ing ones. Comrade Ogilvy, who had never existed in thepresent, now existed in the past, and when once the act offorgery was forgotten, he would exist just as authentical-

ly, and upon the same evidence, as Charlemagne or JuliusCaesar.

Chapter 5

In the low-ceilinged canteen, deep underground, thelunch queue jerked slowly forward. The room was al-ready very full and deafeningly noisy. From the grille at thecounter the steam of stew came pouring forth, with a sourmetallic smell which did not quite overcome the fumes ofVictory Gin. On the far side of the room there was a smallbar, a mere hole in the wall, where gin could be bought atten cents the large nip.

'Just the man I was looking for,' said a voice at Winston'sback.

He turned round. It was his friend Syme, who worked inthe Research Department. Perhaps 'friend' was not exact-ly the right word. You did not have friends nowadays, youhad comrades: but there were some comrades whose societywas pleasanter than that of others. Syme was a philologist, aspecialist in Newspeak. Indeed, he was one of the enormousteam of experts now engaged in compiling the EleventhEdition of the Newspeak Dictionary. He was a tiny creature,smaller than Winston, with dark hair and large, protuber-ant eyes, at once mournful and derisive, which seemed tosearch your face closely while he was speaking to you.

'I wanted to ask you whether you'd got any razor blades,'he said.

'Not one!' said Winston with a sort of guilty haste. 'I've

1984

tried all over the place. They don't exist any longer.'

Everyone kept asking you for razor blades. Actually hehad two unused ones which he was hoarding up. Therehad been a famine of them for months past. At any givenmoment there was some necessary article which the Par-ty shops were unable to supply. Sometimes it was buttons,sometimes it was darning wool, sometimes it was shoelaces;at present it was razor blades. You could only get hold ofthem, if at all, by scrounging more or less furtively on the'free' market.

'I've been using the same blade for six weeks,' he addeduntruthfully.

The queue gave another jerk forward. As they halted heturned and faced Syme again. Each of them took a greasymetal tray from a pile at the end of the counter.

'Did you go and see the prisoners hanged yesterday?' saidSyme.

'I was working,' said Winston indifferently. 'I shall see iton the flicks, I suppose.'

A very inadequate substitute,' said Syme.

His mocking eyes roved over Winston's face. 'I knowyou,' the eyes seemed to say, 'I see through you. I know verywell why you didn't go to see those prisoners hanged.' Inan intellectual way, Syme was venomously orthodox. Hewould talk with a disagreeable gloating satisfaction of he-licopter raids on enemy villages, and trials and confessionsof thought-criminals, the executions in the cellars of theMinistry of Love. Talking to him was largely a matter ofgetting him away from such subjects and entangling him,

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 63

if possible, in the technicalities of Newspeak, on which hewas authoritative and interesting. Winston turned his heada little aside to avoid the scrutiny of the large dark eyes.

'It was a good hanging,' said Syme reminiscently 'I thinkit spoils it when they tie their feet together. I like to see themkicking. And above all, at the end, the tongue sticking rightout, and blue—a quite bright blue. That's the detail that ap-peals to me.'

'Nex', please!' yelled the white-aproned prole with the la-dle.

Winston and Syme pushed their trays beneath the grille.On to each was dumped swiftly the regulation lunch—ametal pannikin of pinkish-grey stew, a hunk of bread, acube of cheese, a mug of milkless Victory Coffee, and onesaccharine tablet.

"There's a table over there, under that telescreen,' saidSyme. 'Let's pick up a gin on the way'

The gin was served out to them in handleless china mugs.They threaded their way across the crowded room and un-packed their trays on to the metal-topped table, on onecorner of which someone had left a pool of stew, a filthyliquid mess that had the appearance of vomit. Winstontook up his mug of gin, paused for an instant to collect hisnerve, and gulped the oily-tasting stuff down. When hehad winked the tears out of his eyes he suddenly discov-ered that he was hungry. He began swallowing spoonfuls ofthe stew, which, in among its general sloppiness, had cubesof spongy pinkish stuff which was probably a preparationof meat. Neither of them spoke again till they had emptied

64 1984

their pannikins. From the table at Winston's left, a littlebehind his back, someone was talking rapidly and contin-uously, a harsh gabble almost like the quacking of a duck,which pierced the general uproar of the room.

'How is the Dictionary getting on?' said Winston, raisinghis voice to overcome the noise.

'Slowly' said Syme. 'I'm on the adjectives. It's fascinat-ing.'

He had brightened up immediately at the mention ofNewspeak. He pushed his pannikin aside, took up his hunkof bread in one delicate hand and his cheese in the other,and leaned across the table so as to be able to speak withoutshouting.

"The Eleventh Edition is the definitive edition,' he said.'We're getting the language into its final shape—the shapeit's going to have when nobody speaks anything else. Whenwe've finished with it, people like you will have to learn itall over again. You think, I dare say, that our chief job isinventing new words. But not a bit of it! We're destroyingwords—scores of them, hundreds of them, every day. We'recutting the language down to the bone. The Eleventh Edi-tion won't contain a single word that will become obsoletebefore the year 2050.'

He bit hungrily into his bread and swallowed a coupleof mouthfuls, then continued speaking, with a sort of ped-ant's passion. His thin dark face had become animated, hiseyes had lost their mocking expression and grown almostdreamy.

'It's a beautiful thing, the destruction of words. Of course

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 65

the great wastage is in the verbs and adjectives, but thereare hundreds of nouns that can be got rid of as well. It isn'tonly the synonyms; there are also the antonyms. After all,what justification is there for a word which is simply theopposite of some other word? A word contains its oppositein itself. Take 'good', for instance. If you have a word like'good', what need is there for a word like 'bad'? 'Ungood'will do just as well—better, because it's an exact opposite,which the other is not. Or again, if you want a stronger ver-sion of 'good', what sense is there in having a whole stringof vague useless words like 'excellent' and 'splendid' and allthe rest of them? 'Plusgood' covers the meaning, or 'double-plusgood' if you want something stronger still. Of coursewe use those forms already, but in the final version of New-speak there'll be nothing else. In the end the whole notionof goodness and badness will be covered by only six words—in reality, only one word. Don't you see the beauty of that,Winston? It was B.B.'s idea originally, of course,' he addedas an afterthought.

A sort of vapid eagerness flitted across Winston's face atthe mention of Big Brother. Nevertheless Syme immediatelydetected a certain lack of enthusiasm.

'You haven't a real appreciation of Newspeak, Winston,'he said almost sadly. 'Even when you write it you're stillthinking in Oldspeak. I've read some of those pieces thatyou write in 'The Times' occasionally. They're good enough,but they're translations. In your heart you'd prefer to stickto Oldspeak, with all its vagueness and its useless shades ofmeaning. You don't grasp the beauty of the destruction of

1984

words. Do you know that Newspeak is the only language inthe world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year?'

Winston did know that, of course. He smiled, sympa-thetically he hoped, not trusting himself to speak. Syme bitoff another fragment of the dark-coloured bread, chewed itbriefly, and went on:

'Don't you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is tonarrow the range of thought? In the end we shall makethoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be nowords in which to express it. Every concept that can everbe needed, will be expressed by exactly one word, with itsmeaning rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meaningsrubbed out and forgotten. Already, in the Eleventh Edition,we're not far from that point. But the process will still becontinuing long after you and I are dead. Every year fewerand fewer words, and the range of consciousness always alittle smaller. Even now, of course, there's no reason or ex-cuse for committing thoughtcrime. It's merely a questionof self-discipline, reality-control. But in the end there won'tbe any need even for that. The Revolution will be com-plete when the language is perfect. Newspeak is Ingsoc andIngsoc is Newspeak,' he added with a sort of mystical satis-faction. 'Has it ever occurred to you, Winston, that by theyear 2050, at the very latest, not a single human being willbe alive who could understand such a conversation as weare having now?'

'Except ' began Winston doubtfully, and he stopped.

It had been on the tip of his tongue to say 'Except theproles,' but he checked himself, not feeling fully certain that

Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 67

this remark was not in some way unorthodox. Syme, how-ever, had divined what he was about to say

"The proles are not human beings,' he said carelessly. 'By2050—earlier, probably—all real knowledge of Oldspeakwill have disappeared. The whole literature of the past willhave been destroyed. Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, By-ron—they'll exist only in Newspeak versions, not merelychanged into something different, but actually changedinto something contradictory of what they used to be. Eventhe literature of the Party will change. Even the slogans willchange. How could you have a slogan like 'freedom is slav-ery' when the concept of freedom has been abolished? Thewhole climate of thought will be different. In fact there willbe no thought, as we understand it now. Orthodoxy meansnot thinking—not needing to think. Orthodoxy is uncon-sciousness.'

One of these days, thought Winston with sudden deepconviction, Syme will be vaporized. He is too intelligent. Hesees too clearly and speaks too plainly. The Party does notlike such people. One day he will disappear. It is written inhis face.

Winston had finished his bread and cheese. He turneda little sideways in his chair to drink his mug of coffee. Atthe table on his left the man with the strident voice wasstill talking remorselessly away. A young woman who wasperhaps his secretary, and who was sitting with her backto Winston, was listening to him and seemed to be eagerlyagreeing with everything that he said. From time to timeWinston caught some such remark as 'I think you're so right,

1984

I do so agree with you', uttered in a youthful and rather sillyfeminine voice. But the other voice never stopped for an in-stant, even when the girl was speaking. Winston knew theman by sight, though he knew no more about him than thathe held some important post in the Fiction Department. Hewas a man of about thirty, with a muscular throat and alarge, mobile mouth. His head was thrown back a little, andbecause of the angle at which he was sitting, his spectaclescaught the light and presented to Winston two blank discsinstead of eyes. What was slightly horrible, was that fromthe stream of sound that poured out of his mouth it wasalmost impossible to distinguish a single word. Just onceWinston caught a phrase—complete and final eliminationof Goldsteinism'—jerked out very rapidly and, as it seemed,all in one piece, like a line of type cast solid. For the rest itwas just a noise, a quack-quack-quacking. And yet, thoughyou could not actually hear what the man was saying, youcould not be in any doubt about its general nature. He mightbe denouncing Goldstein and demanding sterner measuresagainst thought-criminals and saboteurs, he might be ful-minating against the atrocities of the Eurasian army, hemight be praising Big Brother or the heroes on the Malabarfront—it made no difference. Whatever it was, you couldbe certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy, pureIngsoc. As he watched the eyeless face with the jaw movingrapidly up and down, Winston had a curious feeling thatthis was not a real human being but some kind of dummy. Itwas not the man's brain that was speaking, it was his larynx.The stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words, but

it was not speech in the true sense: it was a noise uttered inunconsciousness, like the quacking of a duck.

Syme had fallen silent for a moment, and with the han-dle of his spoon was tracing patterns in the puddle of stew.The voice from the other table quacked rapidly on, easilyaudible in spite of the surrounding din.

"There is a word in Newspeak,' said Syme, 'I don't knowwhether you know it: DUCKSPEAK, to quack like a duck. Itis one of those interesting words that have two contradic-tory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it is abuse, appliedto someone you agree with, it is praise.'

Unquestionably Syme will be vaporized, Winstonthought again. He thought it with a kind of sadness, al-though well knowing that Syme despised him and slightlydisliked him, and was fully capable of denouncing him asa thought-criminal if he saw any reason for doing so. Therewas something subtly wrong with Syme. There was some-thing that he lacked: discretion, aloofness, a sort of savingstupidity. You could not say that he was unorthodox. He be-lieved in the principles of Ingsoc, he venerated Big Brother,he rejoiced over victories, he hated heretics, not merely withsincerity but with a sort of restless zeal, an up-to-datenessof information, which the ordinary Party member did notapproach. Yet a faint air of disreputability always clung tohim. He said things that would have been better unsaid, hehad read too many books, he frequented the Chestnut TreeCafe, haunt of painters and musicians. There was no law,not even an unwritten law, against frequenting the Chest-nut Tree Cafe, yet the place was somehow ill-omened. The

old, discredited leaders of the Party had been used to gatherthere before they were finally purged. Goldstein himself, itwas said, had sometimes been seen there, years and decadesago. Syme's fate was not difficult to foresee. And yet it wasa fact that if Syme grasped, even for three seconds, the na-ture of his, Winston's, secret opinions, he would betray himinstantly to the Thought Police. So would anybody else, forthat matter: but Syme more than most. Zeal was not enough.Orthodoxy was unconsciousness.

Syme looked up. 'Here comes Parsons,' he said.

Something in the tone of his voice seemed to add, 'thatbloody fool'. Parsons, Winston's fellow-tenant at VictoryMansions, was in fact threading his way across the room—a tubby, middle-sized man with fair hair and a froglike face.At thirty-five he was already putting on rolls of fat at neckand waistline, but his movements were brisk and boyish.His whole appearance was that of a little boy grown large, somuch so that although he was wearing the regulation over-alls, it was almost impossible not to think of him as beingdressed in the blue shorts, grey shirt, and red neckerchiefof the Spies. In visualizing him one saw always a pictureof dimpled knees and sleeves rolled back from pudgy fore-arms. Parsons did, indeed, invariably revert to shorts whena community hike or any other physical activity gave himan excuse for doing so. He greeted them both with a cheery'Hullo, hullo!' and sat down at the table, giving off an in-tense smell of sweat. Beads of moisture stood out all overhis pink face. His powers of sweating were extraordinary.At the Community Centre you could always tell when he

had been playing table-tennis by the dampness of the bathandle. Syme had produced a strip of paper on which therewas a long column of words, and was studying it with anink-pencil between his fingers.

'Look at him working away in the lunch hour,' said Par-sons, nudging Winston. 'Keenness, eh? What's that you'vegot there, old boy? Something a bit too brainy for me, I ex-pect. Smith, old boy, I'll tell you why I'm chasing you. It'sthat sub you forgot to give me.'

'Which sub is that?' said Winston, automatically feel-ing for money. About a quarter of one's salary had to beearmarked for voluntary subscriptions, which were so nu-merous that it was difficult to keep track of them.

'For Hate Week. You know—the house-by-house fund.I'm treasurer for our block. We're making an all-out effort—going to put on a tremendous show. I tell you, it won't be myfault if old Victory Mansions doesn't have the biggest outfitof flags in the whole street. Two dollars you promised me.'

Winston found and handed over two creased and filthynotes, which Parsons entered in a small notebook, in theneat handwriting of the illiterate.

'By the way, old boy' he said. 'I hear that little beggar ofmine let fly at you with his catapult yesterday. I gave hima good dressing-down for it. In fact I told him I'd take thecatapult away if he does it again.'

'I think he was a little upset at not going to the execution,'said Winston.

'Ah, well—what I mean to say, shows the right spirit,doesn't it? Mischievous little beggars they are, both of them,

1984

but talk about keenness! All they think about is the Spies,and the war, of course. D'you know what that little girl ofmine did last Saturday, when her troop was on a hike outBerkhamsted way? She got two other girls to go with her,slipped off from the hike, and spent the whole afternoonfollowing a strange man. They kept on his tail for two hours,right through the woods, and then, when they got into Am-ersham, handed him over to the patrols.'

'What did they do that for?' said Winston, somewhat tak-en aback. Parsons went on triumphantly:

'My kid made sure he was some kind of enemy agent—might have been dropped by parachute, for instance. Buthere's the point, old boy. What do you think put her on tohim in the first place? She spotted he was wearing a funnykind of shoes—said she'd never seen anyone wearing shoeslike that before. So the chances were he was a foreigner.Pretty smart for a nipper of seven, eh?'

'What happened to the man?' said Winston.

Ah, that I couldn't say, of course. But I wouldn't be alto-gether surprised if ' Parsons made the motion of aiming

a rifle, and clicked his tongue for the explosion.

'Good,' said Syme abstractedly, without looking up fromhis strip of paper.

'Of course we can't afford to take chances,' agreed Win-ston dutifully.

'What I mean to say, there is a war on,' said Parsons.

As though in confirmation of this, a trumpet call float-ed from the telescreen just above their heads. However, itwas not the proclamation of a military victory this time, but

merely an announcement from the Ministry of Plenty.

'Comrades!' cried an eager youthful voice. 'Attention,comrades! We have glorious news for you. We have won thebattle for production! Returns now completed of the outputof all classes of consumption goods show that the standardof living has risen by no less than 20 per cent over the pastyear. All over Oceania this morning there were irrepressiblespontaneous demonstrations when workers marched out offactories and offices and paraded through the streets withbanners voicing their gratitude to Big Brother for the new,happy life which his wise leadership has bestowed upon us.Here are some of the completed figures. Foodstuffs '

The phrase 'our new, happy life' recurred several times. Ithad been a favourite of late with the Ministry of Plenty. Par-sons, his attention caught by the trumpet call, sat listeningwith a sort of gaping solemnity, a sort of edified boredom.He could not follow the figures, but he was aware that theywere in some way a cause for satisfaction. He had lugged outa huge and filthy pipe which was already half full of charredtobacco. With the tobacco ration at 100 grammes a week itwas seldom possible to fill a pipe to the top. Winston wassmoking a Victory Cigarette which he held carefully hori-zontal. The new ration did not start till tomorrow and hehad only four cigarettes left. For the moment he had shut hisears to the remoter noises and was listening to the stuff thatstreamed out of the telescreen. It appeared that there hadeven been demonstrations to thank Big Brother for raisingthe chocolate ration to twenty grammes a week. And onlyyesterday, he reflected, it had been announced that the ra-

1984

tion was to be REDUCED to twenty grammes a week. Was itpossible that they could swallow that, after only twenty-fourhours? Yes, they swallowed it. Parsons swallowed it easily,with the stupidity of an animal. The eyeless creature at theother table swallowed it fanatically, passionately, with a fu-rious desire to track down, denounce, and vaporize anyonewho should suggest that last week the ration had been thirtygrammes. Syme, too—in some more complex way, involv-ing doublethink, Syme swallowed it. Was he, then, ALONEin the possession of a memory?

The fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the tele-screen. As compared with last year there was more food,more clothes, more houses, more furniture, more cook-ing-pots, more fuel, more ships, more helicopters, morebooks, more babies—more of everything except disease,crime, and insanity. Year by year and minute by minute,everybody and everything was whizzing rapidly upwards.As Syme had done earlier Winston had taken up his spoonand was dabbling in the pale-coloured gravy that dribbledacross the table, drawing a long streak of it out into a pat-tern. He meditated resentfully on the physical texture oflife. Had it always been like this? Had food always tastedlike this? He looked round the canteen. A low-ceilinged,crowded room, its walls grimy from the contact of innu-merable bodies; battered metal tables and chairs, placedso close together that you sat with elbows touching; bentspoons, dented trays, coarse white mugs; all surfaces greasy,grime in every crack; and a sourish, composite smell of badgin and bad coffee and metallic stew and dirty clothes. Al-

ways in your stomach and in your skin there was a sort ofprotest, a feeling that you had been cheated of somethingthat you had a right to. It was true that he had no memoriesof anything greatly different. In any time that he could ac-curately remember, there had never been quite enough toeat, one had never had socks or underclothes that were notfull of holes, furniture had always been battered and rickety,rooms underheated, tube trains crowded, houses falling topieces, bread dark-coloured, tea a rarity, coffee filthy-tast-ing, cigarettes insufficient—nothing cheap and plentifulexcept synthetic gin. And though, of course, it grew worseas one's body aged, was it not a sign that this was NOT thenatural order of things, if one's heart sickened at the dis-comfort and dirt and scarcity, the interminable winters, thestickiness of one's socks, the lifts that never worked, thecold water, the gritty soap, the cigarettes that came to piec-es, the food with its strange evil tastes? Why should one feelit to be intolerable unless one had some kind of ancestralmemory that things had once been different?

He looked round the canteen again. Nearly everyone wasugly, and would still have been ugly even if dressed other-wise than in the uniform blue overalls. On the far side of theroom, sitting at a table alone, a small, curiously beetle-likeman was drinking a cup of coffee, his little eyes darting sus-picious glances from side to side. How easy it was, thoughtWinston, if you did not look about you, to believe that thephysical type set up by the Party as an ideal—tall muscu-lar youths and deep-bosomed maidens, blond-haired, vital,sunburnt, carefree—existed and even predominated. Ac-

tually, so far as he could judge, the majority of people inAirstrip One were small, dark, and ill-favoured. It was curi-ous how that beetle-like type proliferated in the Ministries:little dumpy men, growing stout very early in life, withshort legs, swift scuttling movements, and fat inscrutablefaces with very small eyes. It was the type that seemed toflourish best under the dominion of the Party.

The announcement from the Ministry of Plenty endedon another trumpet call and gave way to tinny music. Par-sons, stirred to vague enthusiasm by the bombardment offigures, took his pipe out of his mouth.

"The Ministry of Plenty's certainly done a good job thisyear,' he said with a knowing shake of his head. 'By the way,Smith old boy, I suppose you haven't got any razor bladesyou can let me have?'

'Not one,' said Winston. 'I've been using the same bladefor six weeks myself

'Ah, well—just thought I'd ask you, old boy'

'Sorry' said Winston.

The quacking voice from the next table, temporarily si-lenced during the Ministry's announcement, had started upagain, as loud as ever. For some reason Winston suddenlyfound himself thinking of Mrs Parsons, with her wispy hairand the dust in the creases of her face. Within two yearsthose children would be denouncing her to the ThoughtPolice. Mrs Parsons would be vaporized. Syme would bevaporized. Winston would be vaporized. O'Brien wouldbe vaporized. Parsons, on the other hand, would never bevaporized. The eyeless creature with the quacking voice

would never be vaporized. The little beetle-like men whoscuttle so nimbly through the labyrinthine corridors ofMinistries they, too, would never be vaporized. And the girlwith dark hair, the girl from the Fiction Department—shewould never be vaporized either. It seemed to him that heknew instinctively who would survive and who would per-ish: though just what it was that made for survival, it wasnot easy to say.

At this moment he was dragged out of his reverie witha violent jerk. The girl at the next table had turned partlyround and was looking at him. It was the girl with dark hair.She was looking at him in a sidelong way, but with curiousintensity. The instant she caught his eye she looked awayagain.

The sweat started out on Winston's backbone. A horri-ble pang of terror went through him. It was gone almost atonce, but it left a sort of nagging uneasiness behind. Whywas she watching him? Why did she keep following himabout? Unfortunately he could not remember whether shehad already been at the table when he arrived, or had comethere afterwards. But yesterday, at any rate, during the TwoMinutes Hate, she had sat immediately behind him whenthere was no apparent need to do so. Quite likely her realobject had been to listen to him and make sure whether hewas shouting loudly enough.

His earlier thought returned to him: probably she wasnot actually a member of the Thought Police, but then itwas precisely the amateur spy who was the greatest dangerof all. He did not know how long she had been looking at

1984

him, but perhaps for as much as five minutes, and it waspossible that his features had not been perfectly under con-trol. It was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wanderwhen you were in any public place or within range of a tele-screen. The smallest thing could give you away. A nervoustic, an unconscious look of anxiety, a habit of muttering toyourself—anything that carried with it the suggestion ofabnormality, of having something to hide. In any case, towear an improper expression on your face (to look incredu-lous when a victory was announced, for example) was itselfa punishable offence. There was even a word for it in New-speak: FACECRIME, it was called.

The girl had turned her back on him again. Perhaps afterall she was not really following him about, perhaps it wascoincidence that she had sat so close to him two days run-ning. His cigarette had gone out, and he laid it carefully onthe edge of the table. He would finish smoking it after work,if he could keep the tobacco in it. Quite likely the personat the next table was a spy of the Thought Police, and quitelikely he would be in the cellars of the Ministry of Lovewithin three days, but a cigarette end must not be wasted.Syme had folded up his strip of paper and stowed it away inhis pocket. Parsons had begun talking again.

'Did I ever tell you, old boy' he said, chuckling round thestem of his pipe, 'about the time when those two nippersof mine set fire to the old market-woman's skirt becausethey saw her wrapping up sausages in a poster of B.B.?Sneaked up behind her and set fire to it with a box of match-es. Burned her quite badly, I believe. Little beggars, eh? But

keen as mustard! That's a first-rate training they give themin the Spies nowadays—better than in my day, even. Whatd'you think's the latest thing they've served them out with?Ear trumpets for listening through keyholes! My little girlbrought one home the other night—tried it out on our sit-ting-room door, and reckoned she could hear twice as muchas with her ear to the hole. Of course it's only a toy, mindyou. Still, gives 'em the right idea, eh?'

At this moment the telescreen let out a piercing whistle.It was the signal to return to work. All three men sprang totheir feet to join in the struggle round the lifts, and the re-maining tobacco fell out of Winston's cigarette.

w

inston was writing in his diary:

It was three years ago. It was on a dark evening, in anarrow side-street near one of the big railway stations. Shewas standing near a doorway in the wall, under a street lampthat hardly gave any light. She had a young face, paintedvery thick. It was really the paint that appealed to me, thewhiteness of it, like a mask, and the bright red lips. Partywomen never paint their faces. There was nobody else in thestreet, and no telescreens. She said two dollars. I

For the moment it was too difficult to go on. He shut hiseyes and pressed his fingers against them, trying to squeezeout the vision that kept recurring. He had an almost over-whelming temptation to shout a string of filthy words at thetop of his voice. Or to bang his head against the wall, to kickover the table, and hurl the inkpot through the window—todo any violent or noisy or painful thing that might blackout the memory that was tormenting him.

Your worst enemy, he reflected, was your own nervoussystem. At any moment the tension inside you was liable totranslate itself into some visible symptom. He thought ofa man whom he had passed in the street a few weeks back;a quite ordinary-looking man, a Party member, aged thir-

ty-five to forty, tallish and thin, carrying a brief-case. Theywere a few metres apart when the left side of the man's facewas suddenly contorted by a sort of spasm. It happenedagain just as they were passing one another: it was only atwitch, a quiver, rapid as the clicking of a camera shutter,but obviously habitual. He remembered thinking at thetime: That poor devil is done for. And what was frighten-ing was that the action was quite possibly unconscious. Themost deadly danger of all was talking in your sleep. Therewas no way of guarding against that, so far as he could see.He drew his breath and went on writing:

/ went with her through the doorway and across a backyardinto a basement kitchen. There was a bed against the wall,and a lamp on the table, turned down very low. She

His teeth were set on edge. He would have liked to spit.Simultaneously with the woman in the basement kitchenhe thought of Katharine, his wife. Winston was married—had been married, at any rate: probably he still was married,so far as he knew his wife was not dead. He seemed tobreathe again the warm stuffy odour of the basement kitch-en, an odour compounded of bugs and dirty clothes andvillainous cheap scent, but nevertheless alluring, becauseno woman of the Party ever used scent, or could be imag-ined as doing so. Only the proles used scent. In his mind thesmell of it was inextricably mixed up with fornication.

When he had gone with that woman it had been his firstlapse in two years or thereabouts. Consorting with prosti-

1984

tutes was forbidden, of course, but it was one of those rulesthat you could occasionally nerve yourself to break. It wasdangerous, but it was not a life-and-death matter. To becaught with a prostitute might mean five years in a forced-labour camp: not more, if you had committed no otheroffence. And it was easy enough, provided that you couldavoid being caught in the act. The poorer quarters swarmedwith women who were ready to sell themselves. Some couldeven be purchased for a bottle of gin, which the proles werenot supposed to drink. Tacitly the Party was even inclinedto encourage prostitution, as an outlet for instincts whichcould not be altogether suppressed. Mere debauchery didnot matter very much, so long as it was furtive and joylessand only involved the women of a submerged and despisedclass. The unforgivable crime was promiscuity betweenParty members. But—though this was one of the crimesthat the accused in the great purges invariably confessedto—it was difficult to imagine any such thing actually hap-pening.

The aim of the Party was not merely to prevent men andwomen from forming loyalties which it might not be ableto control. Its real, undeclared purpose was to remove allpleasure from the sexual act. Not love so much as eroti-cism was the enemy, inside marriage as well as outside it.All marriages between Party members had to be approvedby a committee appointed for the purpose, and—thoughthe principle was never clearly stated—permission was al-ways refused if the couple concerned gave the impressionof being physically attracted to one another. The only rec-

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 83

ognized purpose of marriage was to beget children for theservice of the Party. Sexual intercourse was to be looked onas a slightly disgusting minor operation, like having an en-ema. This again was never put into plain words, but in anindirect way it was rubbed into every Party member fromchildhood onwards. There were even organizations suchas the Junior Anti-Sex League, which advocated completecelibacy for both sexes. All children were to be begottenby artificial insemination (ARTSEM, it was called in New-speak) and brought up in public institutions. This, Winstonwas aware, was not meant altogether seriously, but some-how it fitted in with the general ideology of the Party. TheParty was trying to kill the sex instinct, or, if it could not bekilled, then to distort it and dirty it. He did not know whythis was so, but it seemed natural that it should be so. Andas far as the women were concerned, the Party's efforts werelargely successful.

He thought again of Katharine. It must be nine, ten—nearly eleven years since they had parted. It was curioushow seldom he thought of her. For days at a time he was ca-pable of forgetting that he had ever been married. They hadonly been together for about fifteen months. The Party didnot permit divorce, but it rather encouraged separation incases where there were no children.

Katharine was a tall, fair-haired girl, very straight, withsplendid movements. She had a bold, aquiline face, a facethat one might have called noble until one discovered thatthere was as nearly as possible nothing behind it. Very earlyin her married life he had decided—though perhaps it was

1984

only that he knew her more intimately than he knew mostpeople—that she had without exception the most stupid,vulgar, empty mind that he had ever encountered. She hadnot a thought in her head that was not a slogan, and therewas no imbecility, absolutely none that she was not capableof swallowing if the Party handed it out to her. 'The hu-man sound-track' he nicknamed her in his own mind. Yethe could have endured living with her if it had not been forjust one thing—sex.

As soon as he touched her she seemed to wince and stiff-en. To embrace her was like embracing a jointed woodenimage. And what was strange was that even when she wasclasping him against her he had the feeling that she was si-multaneously pushing him away with all her strength. Therigidity of her muscles managed to convey that impres-sion. She would lie there with shut eyes, neither resistingnor co-operating but SUBMITTING. It was extraordinari-ly embarrassing, and, after a while, horrible. But even thenhe could have borne living with her if it had been agreedthat they should remain celibate. But curiously enough itwas Katharine who refused this. They must, she said, pro-duce a child if they could. So the performance continued tohappen, once a week quite regulariy, whenever it was notimpossible. She even used to remind him of it in the morn-ing, as something which had to be done that evening andwhich must not be forgotten. She had two names for it. Onewas 'making a baby', and the other was 'our duty to the Par-ty' (yes, she had actually used that phrase). Quite soon hegrew to have a feeling of positive dread when the appointed

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 85

day came round. But luckily no child appeared, and in theend she agreed to give up trying, and soon afterwards theyparted.

Winston sighed inaudibly He picked up his pen againand wrote:

She threw herself down on the bed, and at once, without anykind of preliminary in the most coarse, horrible way you canimagine, pulled up her skirt. I

He saw himself standing there in the dim lamplight,with the smell of bugs and cheap scent in his nostrils, andin his heart a feeling of defeat and resentment which evenat that moment was mixed up with the thought of Kath-arine's white body, frozen for ever by the hypnotic powerof the Party. Why did it always have to be like this? Whycould he not have a woman of his own instead of these filthyscuffles at intervals of years? But a real love affair was an al-most unthinkable event. The women of the Party were allalike. Chastity was as deep ingrained in them as Party loy-alty. By careful early conditioning, by games and cold water,by the rubbish that was dinned into them at school and inthe Spies and the Youth League, by lectures, parades, songs,slogans, and martial music, the natural feeling had beendriven out of them. His reason told him that there must beexceptions, but his heart did not believe it. They were all im-pregnable, as the Party intended that they should be. Andwhat he wanted, more even than to be loved, was to breakdown that wall of virtue, even if it were only once in his

1984

whole life. The sexual act, successfully performed, was re-bellion. Desire was thoughtcrime. Even to have awakenedKatharine, if he could have achieved it, would have beenlike a seduction, although she was his wife.

But the rest of the story had got to be written down. Hewrote:

/ turned up the lamp. When I saw her in the light

After the darkness the feeble light of the paraffin lamphad seemed very bright. For the first time he could see thewoman properly. He had taken a step towards her and thenhalted, full of lust and terror. He was painfully conscious ofthe risk he had taken in coming here. It was perfectly pos-sible that the patrols would catch him on the way out: forthat matter they might be waiting outside the door at thismoment. If he went away without even doing what he hadcome here to do !

It had got to be written down, it had got to be confessed.What he had suddenly seen in the lamplight was that thewoman was OLD. The paint was plastered so thick on herface that it looked as though it might crack like a cardboardmask. There were streaks of white in her hair; but the trulydreadful detail was that her mouth had fallen a little open,revealing nothing except a cavernous blackness. She had noteeth at all.

He wrote hurriedly, in scrabbling handwriting:

When I saw her in the light she was quite an old woman, fifty

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 87

years old at least. But I went ahead and did it just the same.

He pressed his ringers against his eyelids again. He hadwritten it down at last, but it made no difference. The thera-py had not worked. The urge to shout filthy words at the topof his voice was as strong as ever.

1984

Chapter 7

' If there is hope,' wrote Winston, 'it lies in the proles.'

If there was hope, it MUST lie in the proles, becauseonly there in those swarming disregarded masses, 85 percent of the population of Oceania, could the force to de-stroy the Party ever be generated. The Party could not beoverthrown from within. Its enemies, if it had any enemies,had no way of coming together or even of identifying oneanother. Even if the legendary Brotherhood existed, as justpossibly it might, it was inconceivable that its memberscould ever assemble in larger numbers than twos and threes.Rebellion meant a look in the eyes, an inflexion of the voice,at the most, an occasional whispered word. But the proles,if only they could somehow become conscious of their ownstrength, would have no need to conspire. They needed onlyto rise up and shake themselves like a horse shaking off flies.If they chose they could blow the Party to pieces tomorrowmorning. Surely sooner or later it must occur to them to do

it? And yet !

He remembered how once he had been walking downa crowded street when a tremendous shout of hundreds ofvoices women's voices—had burst from a side-street a littleway ahead. It was a great formidable cry of anger and de-spair, a deep, loud 'Oh-o-o-o-oh!' that went humming onlike the reverberation of a bell. His heart had leapt. It's start-

ed! he had thought. A riot! The proles are breaking looseat last! When he had reached the spot it was to see a mobof two or three hundred women crowding round the stallsof a street market, with faces as tragic as though they hadbeen the doomed passengers on a sinking ship. But at thismoment the general despair broke down into a multitudeof individual quarrels. It appeared that one of the stallshad been selling tin saucepans. They were wretched, flimsythings, but cooking-pots of any kind were always difficultto get. Now the supply had unexpectedly given out. Thesuccessful women, bumped and jostled by the rest, weretrying to make off with their saucepans while dozens ofothers clamoured round the stall, accusing the stall-keeperof favouritism and of having more saucepans somewherein reserve. There was a fresh outburst of yells. Two bloat-ed women, one of them with her hair coming down, hadgot hold of the same saucepan and were trying to tear itout of one another's hands. For a moment they were bothtugging, and then the handle came off. Winston watchedthem disgustedly. And yet, just for a moment, what almostfrightening power had sounded in that cry from only a fewhundred throats! Why was it that they could never shoutlike that about anything that mattered?He wrote:

Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and untilafter they have rebelled they cannot become conscious.

That, he reflected, might almost have been a transcrip-

90 1984

tion from one of the Party textbooks. The Party claimed, ofcourse, to have liberated the proles from bondage. Beforethe Revolution they had been hideously oppressed by thecapitalists, they had been starved and flogged, women hadbeen forced to work in the coal mines (women still did workin the coal mines, as a matter of fact), children had beensold into the factories at the age of six. But simultaneous-ly, true to the Principles of doublethink, the Party taughtthat the proles were natural inferiors who must be kept insubjection, like animals, by the application of a few simplerules. In reality very little was known about the proles. Itwas not necessary to know much. So long as they contin-ued to work and breed, their other activities were withoutimportance. Left to themselves, like cattle turned looseupon the plains of Argentina, they had reverted to a style oflife that appeared to be natural to them, a sort of ancestralpattern. They were born, they grew up in the gutters, theywent to work at twelve, they passed through a brief blos-soming-period of beauty and sexual desire, they married attwenty, they were middle-aged at thirty, they died, for themost part, at sixty. Heavy physical work, the care of homeand children, petty quarrels with neighbours, films, foot-ball, beer, and above all, gambling, filled up the horizonof their minds. To keep them in control was not difficult.A few agents of the Thought Police moved always amongthem, spreading false rumours and marking down andeliminating the few individuals who were judged capable ofbecoming dangerous; but no attempt was made to indoctri-nate them with the ideology of the Party. It was not desirable

that the proles should have strong political feelings. All thatwas required of them was a primitive patriotism whichcould be appealed to whenever it was necessary to makethem accept longer working-hours or shorter rations. Andeven when they became discontented, as they sometimesdid, their discontent led nowhere, because being withoutgeneral ideas, they could only focus it on petty specificgrievances. The larger evils invariably escaped their notice.The great majority of proles did not even have telescreens intheir homes. Even the civil police interfered with them verylittle. There was a vast amount of criminality in London, awhole world-within-a-world of thieves, bandits, prostitutes,drug-peddlers, and racketeers of every description; butsince it all happened among the proles themselves, it wasof no importance. In all questions of morals they were al-lowed to follow their ancestral code. The sexual puritanismof the Party was not imposed upon them. Promiscuity wentunpunished, divorce was permitted. For that matter, evenreligious worship would have been permitted if the proleshad shown any sign of needing or wanting it. They werebeneath suspicion. As the Party slogan put it: 'Proles andanimals are free.'

Winston reached down and cautiously scratched hisvaricose ulcer. It had begun itching again. The thing youinvariably came back to was the impossibility of knowingwhat life before the Revolution had really been like. He tookout of the drawer a copy of a children's history textbookwhich he had borrowed from Mrs Parsons, and began copy-ing a passage into the diary:

1984

In the old days (it ran), before the glorious Revolution,London was not the beautiful city that we know today. Itwas a dark, dirty, miserable place where hardly anybodyhad enough to eat and where hundreds and thousands ofpoor people had no boots on their feet and not even a roof tosleep under. Children no older than you had to work twelvehours a day for cruel masters who flogged them with whipsif they worked too slowly and fed them on nothing but stalebreadcrusts and water. But in among all this terrible povertythere were just a few great big beautiful houses that werelived in by rich men who had as many as thirty servants tolook after them. These rich men were called capitalists. Theywere fat, ugly men with wicked faces, like the one in thepicture on the opposite page. You can see that he is dressed ina long black coat which was called a frock coat, and a queer,shiny hat shaped like a stovepipe, which was called a top hat.This was the uniform of the capitalists, and no one else wasallowed to wear it. The capitalists owned everything in theworld, and everyone else was their slave. They owned all theland, all the houses, all the factories, and all the money. Ifanyone disobeyed them they could throw them into prison, orthey could take his job away and starve him to death. Whenany ordinary person spoke to a capitalist he had to cringe andbow to him, and take off his cap and address him as 'Sir'. Thechief of all the capitalists was called the King, and

But he knew the rest of the catalogue. There would bemention of the bishops in their lawn sleeves, the judges intheir ermine robes, the pillory, the stocks, the treadmill, the

cat-o'-nine tails, the Lord Mayor's Banquet, and the prac-tice of kissing the Pope's toe. There was also somethingcalled the JUS PRIMAE NOCTIS, which would probablynot be mentioned in a textbook for children. It was the lawby which every capitalist had the right to sleep with anywoman working in one of his factories.

How could you tell how much of it was lies? It MIGHTbe true that the average human being was better off nowthan he had been before the Revolution. The only evidenceto the contrary was the mute protest in your own bones, theinstinctive feeling that the conditions you lived in were in-tolerable and that at some other time they must have beendifferent. It struck him that the truly characteristic thingabout modern life was not its cruelty and insecurity, butsimply its bareness, its dinginess, its listlessness. Life, if youlooked about you, bore no resemblance not only to the liesthat streamed out of the telescreens, but even to the idealsthat the Party was trying to achieve. Great areas of it, evenfor a Party member, were neutral and non-political, a mat-ter of slogging through dreary jobs, fighting for a place onthe Tube, darning a worn-out sock, cadging a saccharinetablet, saving a cigarette end. The ideal set up by the Par-ty was something huge, terrible, and glittering—a world ofsteel and concrete, of monstrous machines and terrifyingweapons—a nation of warriors and fanatics, marching for-ward in perfect unity, all thinking the same thoughts andshouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting,triumphing, persecuting—three hundred million people allwith the same face. The reality was decaying, dingy cities

1984

where underfed people shuffled to and fro in leaky shoes,in patched-up nineteenth-century houses that smelt alwaysof cabbage and bad lavatories. He seemed to see a vision ofLondon, vast and ruinous, city of a million dustbins, andmixed up with it was a picture of Mrs Parsons, a womanwith lined face and wispy hair, fiddling helplessly with ablocked waste-pipe.

He reached down and scratched his ankle again. Dayand night the telescreens bruised your ears with statisticsproving that people today had more food, more clothes,better houses, better recreations—that they lived longer,worked shorter hours, were bigger, healthier, stronger, hap-pier, more intelligent, better educated, than the people offifty years ago. Not a word of it could ever be proved or dis-proved. The Party claimed, for example, that today 40 percent of adult proles were literate: before the Revolution, itwas said, the number had only been 15 per cent. The Partyclaimed that the infant mortality rate was now only 160 perthousand, whereas before the Revolution it had been 300—and so it went on. It was like a single equation with twounknowns. It might very well be that literally every word inthe history books, even the things that one accepted with-out question, was pure fantasy. For all he knew there mightnever have been any such law as the JUS PRIMAE NOCTIS,or any such creature as a capitalist, or any such garment asa top hat.

Everything faded into mist. The past was erased, the era-sure was forgotten, the lie became truth. Just once in hislife he had possessed—AFTER the event: that was what

counted—concrete, unmistakable evidence of an act of fal-sification. He had held it between his fingers for as long asthirty seconds. In 1973, it must have been—at any rate, itwas at about the time when he and Katharine had parted.But the really relevant date was seven or eight years earlier.The story really began in the middle sixties, the period ofthe great purges in which the original leaders of the Revolu-tion were wiped out once and for all. By 1970 none of themwas left, except Big Brother himself. All the rest had by thattime been exposed as traitors and counter-revolutionar-ies. Goldstein had fled and was hiding no one knew where,and of the others, a few had simply disappeared, while themajority had been executed after spectacular public trialsat which they made confession of their crimes. Among thelast survivors were three men named Jones, Aaronson, andRutherford. It must have been in 1965 that these three hadbeen arrested. As often happened, they had vanished for ayear or more, so that one did not know whether they werealive or dead, and then had suddenly been brought forthto incriminate themselves in the usual way. They had con-fessed to intelligence with the enemy (at that date, too, theenemy was Eurasia), embezzlement of public funds, themurder of various trusted Party members, intrigues againstthe leadership of Big Brother which had started long beforethe Revolution happened, and acts of sabotage causing thedeath of hundreds of thousands of people. After confess-ing to these things they had been pardoned, reinstated inthe Party, and given posts which were in fact sinecures butwhich sounded important. All three had written long, ab-

96 1984

ject articles in "The Times', analysing the reasons for theirdefection and promising to make amends.

Some time after their release Winston had actually seenall three of them in the Chestnut Tree Cafe. He rememberedthe sort of terrified fascination with which he had watchedthem out of the corner of his eye. They were men far old-er than himself, relics of the ancient world, almost the lastgreat figures left over from the heroic days of the Party. Theglamour of the underground struggle and the civil war stillfaintly clung to them. He had the feeling, though already atthat time facts and dates were growing blurry, that he hadknown their names years earlier than he had known that ofBig Brother. But also they were outlaws, enemies, untouch-ables, doomed with absolute certainty to extinction withina year or two. No one who had once fallen into the handsof the Thought Police ever escaped in the end. They werecorpses waiting to be sent back to the grave.

There was no one at any of the tables nearest to them. Itwas not wise even to be seen in the neighbourhood of suchpeople. They were sitting in silence before glasses of the ginflavoured with cloves which was the speciality of the cafe.Of the three, it was Rutherford whose appearance had mostimpressed Winston. Rutherford had once been a famouscaricaturist, whose brutal cartoons had helped to inflamepopular opinion before and during the Revolution. Evennow, at long intervals, his cartoons were appearing in TheTimes. They were simply an imitation of his earlier manner,and curiously lifeless and unconvincing. Always they werea rehashing of the ancient themes—slum tenements, starv-

ing children, street battles, capitalists in top hats—even onthe barricades the capitalists still seemed to cling to theirtop hats an endless, hopeless effort to get back into the past.He was a monstrous man, with a mane of greasy grey hair,his face pouched and seamed, with thick negroid lips. Atone time he must have been immensely strong; now hisgreat body was sagging, sloping, bulging, falling away inevery direction. He seemed to be breaking up before one'seyes, like a mountain crumbling.

It was the lonely hour of fifteen. Winston could notnow remember how he had come to be in the cafe at sucha time. The place was almost empty. A tinny music wastrickling from the telescreens. The three men sat in theircorner almost motionless, never speaking. Uncommanded,the waiter brought fresh glasses of gin. There was a chess-board on the table beside them, with the pieces set out butno game started. And then, for perhaps half a minute in all,something happened to the telescreens. The tune that theywere playing changed, and the tone of the music changedtoo. There came into it—but it was something hard to de-scribe. It was a peculiar, cracked, braying, jeering note: inhis mind Winston called it a yellow note. And then a voicefrom the telescreen was singing:

Under the spreading chestnut treeI sold you and you sold me:There lie they, and here lie weUnder the spreading chestnut tree.

1984

The three men never stirred. But when Winston glancedagain at Rutherford's ruinous face, he saw that his eyeswere full of tears. And for the first time he noticed, with akind of inward shudder, and yet not knowing AT WHAThe shuddered, that both Aaronson and Rutherford had bro-ken noses.

A little later all three were re-arrested. It appeared thatthey had engaged in fresh conspiracies from the very mo-ment of their release. At their second trial they confessed toall their old crimes over again, with a whole string of newones. They were executed, and their fate was recorded inthe Party histories, a warning to posterity. About five yearsafter this, in 1973, Winston was unrolling a wad of docu-ments which had just flopped out of the pneumatic tube onto his desk when he came on a fragment of paper whichhad evidently been slipped in among the others and thenforgotten. The instant he had flattened it out he saw its sig-nificance. It was a half-page torn out of'The Times' of aboutten years earlier—the top half of the page, so that it includedthe date—and it contained a photograph of the delegates atsome Party function in New York. Prominent in the middleof the group were Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford. Therewas no mistaking them, in any case their names were in thecaption at the bottom.

The point was that at both trials all three men had con-fessed that on that date they had been on Eurasian soil. Theyhad flown from a secret airfield in Canada to a rendezvoussomewhere in Siberia, and had conferred with members ofthe Eurasian General Staff, to whom they had betrayed im-

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 99

portant military secrets. The date had stuck in Winston'smemory because it chanced to be midsummer day; but thewhole story must be on record in countless other places aswell. There was only one possible conclusion: the confes-sions were lies.

Of course, this was not in itself a discovery. Even at thattime Winston had not imagined that the people who werewiped out in the purges had actually committed the crimesthat they were accused of. But this was concrete evidence;it was a fragment of the abolished past, like a fossil bonewhich turns up in the wrong stratum and destroys a geo-logical theory. It was enough to blow the Party to atoms, ifin some way it could have been published to the world andits significance made known.

He had gone straight on working. As soon as he saw whatthe photograph was, and what it meant, he had covered itup with another sheet of paper. Luckily, when he unrolledit, it had been upside-down from the point of view of thetelescreen.

He took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed backhis chair so as to get as far away from the telescreen as pos-sible. To keep your face expressionless was not difficult, andeven your breathing could be controlled, with an effort:but you could not control the beating of your heart, andthe telescreen was quite delicate enough to pick it up. Helet what he judged to be ten minutes go by, tormented allthe while by the fear that some accident—a sudden draughtblowing across his desk, for instance—would betray him.Then, without uncovering it again, he dropped the photo-

1984

graph into the memory hole, along with some other wastepapers. Within another minute, perhaps, it would havecrumbled into ashes.

That was ten—eleven years ago. Today, probably, hewould have kept that photograph. It was curious that thefact of having held it in his fingers seemed to him to makea difference even now, when the photograph itself, as wellas the event it recorded, was only memory. Was the Party'shold upon the past less strong, he wondered, because a pieceof evidence which existed no longer HAD ONCE existed?

But today, supposing that it could be somehow resur-rected from its ashes, the photograph might not even beevidence. Already, at the time when he made his discov-ery, Oceania was no longer at war with Eurasia, and it musthave been to the agents of Eastasia that the three dead menhad betrayed their country. Since then there had been oth-er changes—two, three, he could not remember how many.Very likely the confessions had been rewritten and rewrittenuntil the original facts and dates no longer had the small-est significance. The past not only changed, but changedcontinuously. What most afflicted him with the sense ofnightmare was that he had never clearly understood whythe huge imposture was undertaken. The immediate advan-tages of falsifying the past were obvious, but the ultimatemotive was mysterious. He took up his pen again andwrote:

/ understand HOW: I do not understand WHY.

He wondered, as he had many times wondered before,whether he himself was a lunatic. Perhaps a lunatic wassimply a minority of one. At one time it had been a sign ofmadness to believe that the earth goes round the sun; today,to believe that the past is inalterable. He might be ALONEin holding that belief, and if alone, then a lunatic. But thethought of being a lunatic did not greatly trouble him: thehorror was that he might also be wrong.

He picked up the children's history book and looked atthe portrait of Big Brother which formed its frontispiece.The hypnotic eyes gazed into his own. It was as thoughsome huge force were pressing down upon you—somethingthat penetrated inside your skull, battering against yourbrain, frightening you out of your beliefs, persuading you,almost, to deny the evidence of your senses. In the end theParty would announce that two and two made five, and youwould have to believe it. It was inevitable that they shouldmake that claim sooner or later: the logic of their positiondemanded it. Not merely the validity of experience, but thevery existence of external reality, was tacitly denied by theirphilosophy. The heresy of heresies was common sense. Andwhat was terrifying was not that they would kill you forthinking otherwise, but that they might be right. For, afterall, how do we know that two and two make four? Or thatthe force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchange-able? If both the past and the external world exist only inthe mind, and if the mind itself is controllable what then?

But no! His courage seemed suddenly to stiffen of itsown accord. The face of O'Brien, not called up by any obvi-

1984

ous association, had floated into his mind. He knew, withmore certainty than before, that O'Brien was on his side.He was writing the diary for O'Brien—TO O'Brien: it waslike an interminable letter which no one would ever read,but which was addressed to a particular person and took itscolour from that fact.

The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes andears. It was their final, most essential command. His heartsank as he thought of the enormous power arrayed againsthim, the ease with which any Party intellectual would over-throw him in debate, the subtle arguments which he wouldnot be able to understand, much less answer. And yet hewas in the right! They were wrong and he was right. Theobvious, the silly, and the true had got to be defended. Tru-isms are true, hold on to that! The solid world exists, its lawsdo not change. Stones are hard, water is wet, objects unsup-ported fall towards the earth's centre. With the feeling thathe was speaking to O'Brien, and also that he was settingforth an important axiom, he wrote:

Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. Ifthat is granted, all else follows.

Chapter 8

From somewhere at the bottom of a passage the smell ofroasting coffee—real coffee, not Victory Coffee—camefloating out into the street. Winston paused involuntarily.For perhaps two seconds he was back in the half-forgottenworld of his childhood. Then a door banged, seeming to cutoff the smell as abruptly as though it had been a sound.

He had walked several kilometres over pavements, andhis varicose ulcer was throbbing. This was the second timein three weeks that he had missed an evening at the Com-munity Centre: a rash act, since you could be certain thatthe number of your attendances at the Centre was care-fully checked. In principle a Party member had no sparetime, and was never alone except in bed. It was assumedthat when he was not working, eating, or sleeping he wouldbe taking part in some kind of communal recreation: to doanything that suggested a taste for solitude, even to go for awalk by yourself, was always slightly dangerous. There wasa word for it in Newspeak: OWNLIFE, it was called, mean-ing individualism and eccentricity. But this evening as hecame out of the Ministry the balminess of the April air hadtempted him. The sky was a warmer blue than he had seen itthat year, and suddenly the long, noisy evening at the Cen-tre, the boring, exhausting games, the lectures, the creakingcamaraderie oiled by gin, had seemed intolerable. On im-

1984

pulse he had turned away from the bus-stop and wanderedoff into the labyrinth of London, first south, then east, thennorth again, losing himself among unknown streets andhardly bothering in which direction he was going.

'If there is hope,' he had written in the diary, 'it lies inthe proles.' The words kept coming back to him, statementof a mystical truth and a palpable absurdity. He was some-where in the vague, brown-coloured slums to the north andeast of what had once been Saint Pancras Station. He waswalking up a cobbled street of little two-storey houses withbattered doorways which gave straight on the pavementand which were somehow curiously suggestive of ratholes.There were puddles of filthy water here and there among thecobbles. In and out of the dark doorways, and down narrowalley-ways that branched off on either side, people swarmedin astonishing numbers—girls in full bloom, with crude-ly lipsticked mouths, and youths who chased the girls, andswollen waddling women who showed you what the girlswould be like in ten years' time, and old bent creatures shuf-fling along on splayed feet, and ragged barefooted childrenwho played in the puddles and then scattered at angry yellsfrom their mothers. Perhaps a quarter of the windows inthe street were broken and boarded up. Most of the peoplepaid no attention to Winston; a few eyed him with a sort ofguarded curiosity. Two monstrous women with brick-redforearms folded across their aprons were talking outside adoorway. Winston caught scraps of conversation as he ap-proached.

"Yes,' I says to 'er, 'that's all very well,' I says. 'But if you'd

of been in my place you'd of done the same as what I done.It's easy to criticize,' I says, 'but you ain't got the same prob-lems as what I got."

'Ah,' said the other, 'that's jest it. That's jest where it is.'

The strident voices stopped abruptly. The women stud-ied him in hostile silence as he went past. But it was nothostility, exactly; merely a kind of wariness, a momentarystiffening, as at the passing of some unfamiliar animal. Theblue overalls of the Party could not be a common sight ina street like this. Indeed, it was unwise to be seen in suchplaces, unless you had definite business there. The patrolsmight stop you if you happened to run into them. 'May I seeyour papers, comrade? What are you doing here? What timedid you leave work? Is this your usual way home?'—and soon and so forth. Not that there was any rule against walkinghome by an unusual route: but it was enough to draw atten-tion to you if the Thought Police heard about it.

Suddenly the whole street was in commotion. Therewere yells of warning from all sides. People were shootinginto the doorways like rabbits. A young woman leapt outof a doorway a little ahead of Winston, grabbed up a tinychild playing in a puddle, whipped her apron round it, andleapt back again, all in one movement. At the same instant aman in a concertina-like black suit, who had emerged froma side alley, ran towards Winston, pointing excitedly to thesky.

'Steamer!' he yelled. 'Look out, guv'nor! Bang over'ead!Lay down quick!'

'Steamer' was a nickname which, for some reason, the

1984

proles applied to rocket bombs. Winston promptly flunghimself on his face. The proles were nearly always rightwhen they gave you a warning of this kind. They seemedto possess some kind of instinct which told them severalseconds in advance when a rocket was coming, althoughthe rockets supposedly travelled faster than sound. Win-ston clasped his forearms above his head. There was a roarthat seemed to make the pavement heave; a shower of lightobjects pattered on to his back. When he stood up he foundthat he was covered with fragments of glass from the near-est window.

He walked on. The bomb had demolished a group ofhouses 200 metres up the street. A black plume of smokehung in the sky, and below it a cloud of plaster dust in whicha crowd was already forming around the ruins. There was alittle pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him, andin the middle of it he could see a bright red streak. When hegot up to it he saw that it was a human hand severed at thewrist. Apart from the bloody stump, the hand was so com-pletely whitened as to resemble a plaster cast.

He kicked the thing into the gutter, and then, to avoidthe crowd, turned down a side-street to the right. With-in three or four minutes he was out of the area which thebomb had affected, and the sordid swarming life of thestreets was going on as though nothing had happened. Itwas nearly twenty hours, and the drinking-shops which theproles frequented (pubs', they called them) were chokedwith customers. From their grimy swing doors, endlesslyopening and shutting, there came forth a smell of urine,

sawdust, and sour beer. In an angle formed by a projectinghouse-front three men were standing very close togeth-er, the middle one of them holding a folded-up newspaperwhich the other two were studying over his shoulder. Evenbefore he was near enough to make out the expression ontheir faces, Winston could see absorption in every line oftheir bodies. It was obviously some serious piece of newsthat they were reading. He was a few paces away from themwhen suddenly the group broke up and two of the men werein violent altercation. For a moment they seemed almost onthe point of blows.

'Can't you bleeding well listen to what I say? I tell youno number ending in seven ain't won for over fourteenmonths!'

'Yes, it 'as, then!'

'No, it 'as not! Back 'ome I got the 'ole lot of 'em for overtwo years wrote down on a piece of paper. I takes 'em downreg'lar as the clock. An' I tell you, no number ending inseven '

'Yes, a seven 'AS won! I could pretty near tell you thebleeding number. Four oh seven, it ended in. It were in Feb-ruary—second week in February'

'February your grandmother! I got it all down in blackand white. An' I tell you, no number '

'Oh, pack it in!' said the third man.

They were talking about the Lottery. Winston lookedback when he had gone thirty metres. They were still ar-guing, with vivid, passionate faces. The Lottery, with itsweekly pay-out of enormous prizes, was the one public event

1984

to which the proles paid serious attention. It was probablethat there were some millions of proles for whom the Lot-tery was the principal if not the only reason for remainingalive. It was their delight, their folly, their anodyne, theirintellectual stimulant. Where the Lottery was concerned,even people who could barely read and write seemed capa-ble of intricate calculations and staggering feats of memory.There was a whole tribe of men who made a living simply byselling systems, forecasts, and lucky amulets. Winston hadnothing to do with the running of the Lottery, which wasmanaged by the Ministry of Plenty, but he was aware (in-deed everyone in the party was aware) that the prizes werelargely imaginary. Only small sums were actually paid out,the winners of the big prizes being non-existent persons. Inthe absence of any real intercommunication between onepart of Oceania and another, this was not difficult to ar-range.

But if there was hope, it lay in the proles. You had to clingon to that. When you put it in words it sounded reasonable:it was when you looked at the human beings passing you onthe pavement that it became an act of faith. The street intowhich he had turned ran downhill. He had a feeling that hehad been in this neighbourhood before, and that there wasa main thoroughfare not far away. From somewhere aheadthere came a din of shouting voices. The street took a sharpturn and then ended in a flight of steps which led down intoa sunken alley where a few stall-keepers were selling tired-looking vegetables. At this moment Winston rememberedwhere he was. The alley led out into the main street, and

down the next turning, not five minutes away, was the junk-shop where he had bought the blank book which was nowhis diary. And in a small stationer's shop not far away hehad bought his penholder and his bottle of ink.

He paused for a moment at the top of the steps. On theopposite side of the alley there was a dingy little pub whosewindows appeared to be frosted over but in reality weremerely coated with dust. A very old man, bent but active,with white moustaches that bristled forward like those of aprawn, pushed open the swing door and went in. As Win-ston stood watching, it occurred to him that the old man,who must be eighty at the least, had already been middle-aged when the Revolution happened. He and a few otherslike him were the last links that now existed with the van-ished world of capitalism. In the Party itself there were notmany people left whose ideas had been formed before theRevolution. The older generation had mostly been wiped outin the great purges of the fifties and sixties, and the few whosurvived had long ago been terrified into complete intellec-tual surrender. If there was any one still alive who couldgive you a truthful account of conditions in the early partof the century, it could only be a prole. Suddenly the pas-sage from the history book that he had copied into his diarycame back into Winston's mind, and a lunatic impulse tookhold of him. He would go into the pub, he would scrape ac-quaintance with that old man and question him. He wouldsay to him: 'Tell me about your life when you were a boy.What was it like in those days? Were things better than theyare now, or were they worse?'

1984

Hurriedly, lest he should have time to become frightened,he descended the steps and crossed the narrow street. Itwas madness of course. As usual, there was no definite ruleagainst talking to proles and frequenting their pubs, but itwas far too unusual an action to pass unnoticed. If the pa-trols appeared he might plead an attack of faintness, but itwas not likely that they would believe him. He pushed openthe door, and a hideous cheesy smell of sour beer hit him inthe face. As he entered the din of voices dropped to abouthalf its volume. Behind his back he could feel everyone eye-ing his blue overalls. A game of darts which was going on atthe other end of the room interrupted itself for perhaps asmuch as thirty seconds. The old man whom he had followedwas standing at the bar, having some kind of altercationwith the barman, a large, stout, hook-nosed young manwith enormous forearms. A knot of others, standing roundwith glasses in their hands, were watching the scene.

'I arst you civil enough, didn't I?' said the old man,straightening his shoulders pugnaciously. 'You telling meyou ain't got a pint mug in the 'ole bleeding boozer?'

And what in hell's name IS a pint?' said the barman, lean-ing forward with the tips of his fingers on the counter.

"Ark at 'im! Calls 'isself a barman and don't know whata pint is! Why, a pint's the 'alf of a quart, and there's fourquarts to the gallon. Ave to teach you the A, B, C next.'

'Never heard of 'em,' said the barman shortly. 'Litre andhalf litre—that's all we serve. There's the glasses on the shelfin front of you.'

'I likes a pint,' persisted the old man. 'You could 'a drawed

me off a pint easy enough. We didn't 'ave these bleeding li-tres when I was a young man.'

'When you were a young man we were all living in thetreetops,' said the barman, with a glance at the other cus-tomers.

There was a shout of laughter, and the uneasiness causedby Winston's entry seemed to disappear. The old man's whit-estubbled face had flushed pink. He turned away, mutteringto himself, and bumped into Winston. Winston caught himgently by the arm.

'May I offer you a drink?' he said.

'You're a gent,' said the other, straightening his shoul-ders again. He appeared not to have noticed Winston's blueoveralls. 'Pint!' he added aggressively to the barman. 'Pintof wallop.'

The barman swished two half-litres of dark-brown beerinto thick glasses which he had rinsed in a bucket underthe counter. Beer was the only drink you could get in prolepubs. The proles were supposed not to drink gin, though inpractice they could get hold of it easily enough. The game ofdarts was in full swing again, and the knot of men at the barhad begun talking about lottery tickets. Winston's presencewas forgotten for a moment. There was a deal table underthe window where he and the old man could talk withoutfear of being overheard. It was horribly dangerous, but atany rate there was no telescreen in the room, a point he hadmade sure of as soon as he came in.

"E could 'a drawed me off a pint,' grumbled the old manas he settled down behind a glass. 'A 'alf litre ain't enough. It

1984

don't satisfy. And a 'ole litre's too much. It starts my bladderrunning. Let alone the price.'

'You must have seen great changes since you were a youngman,' said Winston tentatively.

The old man's pale blue eyes moved from the darts boardto the bar, and from the bar to the door of the Gents, asthough it were in the bar-room that he expected the chang-es to have occurred.

"The beer was better,' he said finally. 'And cheaper! WhenI was a young man, mild beer—wallop we used to call it—was fourpence a pint. That was before the war, of course.'

'Which war was that?' said Winston.

'It's all wars,' said the old man vaguely. He took up hisglass, and his shoulders straightened again. "Ere's wishingyou the very best of'ealth!'

In his lean throat the sharp-pointed Adam's apple madea surprisingly rapid up-and-down movement, and the beervanished. Winston went to the bar and came back with twomore half-litres. The old man appeared to have forgottenhis prejudice against drinking a full litre.

'You are very much older than I am,' said Winston. 'Youmust have been a grown man before I was born. You canremember what it was like in the old days, before the Revo-lution. People of my age don't really know anything aboutthose times. We can only read about them in books, andwhat it says in the books may not be true. I should like youropinion on that. The history books say that life before theRevolution was completely different from what it is now.There was the most terrible oppression, injustice, poverty

worse than anything we can imagine. Here in London, thegreat mass of the people never had enough to eat from birthto death. Half of them hadn't even boots on their feet. Theyworked twelve hours a day, they left school at nine, theyslept ten in a room. And at the same time there were a veryfew people, only a few thousands—the capitalists, they werecalled—who were rich and powerful. They owned every-thing that there was to own. They lived in great gorgeoushouses with thirty servants, they rode about in motor-carsand four-horse carriages, they drank champagne, they woretop hats '

The old man brightened suddenly.

'Top 'ats!' he said. 'Funny you should mention 'em. Thesame thing come into my 'ead only yesterday, I dono why. Iwas jest thinking, I ain't seen a top 'at in years. Gorn rightout, they 'ave. The last time I wore one was at my sister-in-law's funeral. And that was—well, I couldn't give you thedate, but it must'a been fifty years ago. Of course it was only'ired for the occasion, you understand.'

'It isn't very important about the top hats,' said Winstonpatiently. 'The point is, these capitalists—they and a fewlawyers and priests and so forth who lived on them—werethe lords of the earth. Everything existed for their benefit.You—the ordinary people, the workers—were their slaves.They could do what they liked with you. They could shipyou off to Canada like cattle. They could sleep with yourdaughters if they chose. They could order you to be floggedwith something called a cat-o'-nine tails. You had to takeyour cap off when you passed them. Every capitalist went

1984

about with a gang of lackeys who '

The old man brightened again.

'Lackeys!' he said. 'Now there's a word I ain't 'eard sinceever so long. Lackeys! That reg'lar takes me back, that does.I recollect oh, donkey's years ago—I used to sometimes goto 'Yde Park of a Sunday afternoon to 'ear the blokes makingspeeches. Salvation Army, Roman Catholics, Jews, Indi-ans—all sorts there was. And there was one bloke—well, Icouldn't give you 'is name, but a real powerful speaker 'ewas. 'E didn't 'alf give it 'em! 'Lackeys!' 'e says, 'lackeys ofthe bourgeoisie! Flunkies of the ruling class!' Parasites—that was another of them. And 'yenas—'e definitely called'em 'yenas. Of course 'e was referring to the Labour Party,you understand.'

Winston had the feeling that they were talking at cross-purposes.

'What I really wanted to know was this,' he said. 'Do youfeel that you have more freedom now than you had in thosedays? Are you treated more like a human being? In the olddays, the rich people, the people at the top '

'The 'Ouse of Lords,' put in the old man reminiscently

'The House of Lords, if you like. What I am asking is,were these people able to treat you as an inferior, simplybecause they were rich and you were poor? Is it a fact, forinstance, that you had to call them 'Sir' and take off yourcap when you passed them?'

The old man appeared to think deeply. He drank offabout a quarter of his beer before answering.

'Yes,' he said. "They liked you to touch your cap to 'em.

It showed respect, like. I didn't agree with it, myself, but Idone it often enough. Had to, as you might say'

'And was it usual—I'm only quoting what I've read in his-tory books—was it usual for these people and their servantsto push you off the pavement into the gutter?'

'One of 'em pushed me once,' said the old man. 'I recol-lect it as if it was yesterday. It was Boat Race night—terriblyrowdy they used to get on Boat Race night—and I bumpsinto a young bloke on Shaftesbury Avenue. Quite a gent,'e was—dress shirt, top 'at, black overcoat. 'E was kind ofzig-zagging across the pavement, and I bumps into 'im acci-dental-like. 'E says, 'Why can't you look where you're going?''e says. I say, 'Ju think you've bought the bleeding pavement?''E says, 'I'll twist your bloody 'ead off if you get fresh withme.' I says, 'You're drunk. I'll give you in charge in 'alf aminute,' I says. An' if you'll believe me, 'e puts 'is 'and on mychest and gives me a shove as pretty near sent me under thewheels of a bus. Well, I was young in them days, and I wasgoing to 'ave fetched 'im one, only '

A sense of helplessness took hold of Winston. The oldman's memory was nothing but a rubbish-heap of details.One could question him all day without getting any realinformation. The party histories might still be true, after afashion: they might even be completely true. He made a lastattempt.

'Perhaps I have not made myself clear,' he said. 'What I'mtrying to say is this. You have been alive a very long time;you lived half your life before the Revolution. In 1925, forinstance, you were already grown up. Would you say from

1984

what you can remember, that life in 1925 was better than itis now, or worse? If you could choose, would you prefer tolive then or now?'

The old man looked meditatively at the darts board. Hefinished up his beer, more slowly than before. When hespoke it was with a tolerant philosophical air, as though thebeer had mellowed him.

'I know what you expect me to say' he said. 'You expectme to say as I'd sooner be young again. Most people'd saythey'd sooner be young, if you arst' 'em. You got your 'ealthand strength when you're young. When you get to my timeof life you ain't never well. I suffer something wicked frommy feet, and my bladder's jest terrible. Six and seven timesa night it 'as me out of bed. On the other 'and, there's greatadvantages in being a old man. You ain't got the same wor-ries. No truck with women, and that's a great thing. I ain't'ad a woman for near on thirty year, if you'd credit it. Norwanted to, what's more.'

Winston sat back against the window-sill. It was no usegoing on. He was about to buy some more beer when the oldman suddenly got up and shuffled rapidly into the stink-ing urinal at the side of the room. The extra half-litre wasalready working on him. Winston sat for a minute or twogazing at his empty glass, and hardly noticed when his feetcarried him out into the street again. Within twenty yearsat the most, he reflected, the huge and simple question,'Was life better before the Revolution than it is now?' wouldhave ceased once and for all to be answerable. But in effectit was unanswerable even now, since the few scattered sur-

vivors from the ancient world were incapable of comparingone age with another. They remembered a million uselessthings, a quarrel with a workmate, a hunt for a lost bicy-cle pump, the expression on a long-dead sister's face, theswirls of dust on a windy morning seventy years ago: butall the relevant facts were outside the range of their vision.They were like the ant, which can see small objects but notlarge ones. And when memory failed and written recordswere falsified—when that happened, the claim of the Partyto have improved the conditions of human life had got to beaccepted, because there did not exist, and never again couldexist, any standard against which it could be tested.

At this moment his train of thought stopped abruptly.He halted and looked up. He was in a narrow street, with afew dark little shops, interspersed among dwelling-houses.Immediately above his head there hung three discolouredmetal balls which looked as if they had once been gilded.He seemed to know the place. Of course! He was standingoutside the junk-shop where he had bought the diary.

A twinge of fear went through him. It had been a suf-ficiently rash act to buy the book in the beginning, and hehad sworn never to come near the place again. And yet theinstant that he allowed his thoughts to wander, his feet hadbrought him back here of their own accord. It was preciselyagainst suicidal impulses of this kind that he had hoped toguard himself by opening the diary. At the same time henoticed that although it was nearly twenty-one hours theshop was still open. With the feeling that he would be lessconspicuous inside than hanging about on the pavement,

1984

he stepped through the doorway. If questioned, he couldplausibly say that he was trying to buy razor blades.

The proprietor had just lighted a hanging oil lamp whichgave off an unclean but friendly smell. He was a man of per-haps sixty, frail and bowed, with a long, benevolent nose,and mild eyes distorted by thick spectacles. His hair was al-most white, but his eyebrows were bushy and still black. Hisspectacles, his gentle, fussy movements, and the fact that hewas wearing an aged jacket of black velvet, gave him a vagueair of intellectuality, as though he had been some kind ofliterary man, or perhaps a musician. His voice was soft, asthough faded, and his accent less debased than that of themajority of proles.

'I recognized you on the pavement,' he said immediately.'You're the gentleman that bought the young lady's keepsakealbum. That was a beautiful bit of paper, that was. Cream-laid, it used to be called. There's been no paper like thatmade for—oh, I dare say fifty years.' He peered at Winstonover the top of his spectacles. 'Is there anything special Ican do for you? Or did you just want to look round?'

T was passing,' said Winston vaguely. T just looked in. Idon't want anything in particular.'

'It's just as well,' said the other, 'because I don't supposeI could have satisfied you.' He made an apologetic gesturewith his softpalmed hand. 'You see how it is; an empty shop,you might say. Between you and me, the antique trade's justabout finished. No demand any longer, and no stock either.Furniture, china, glass it's all been broken up by degrees.And of course the metal stuff's mostly been melted down. I

haven't seen a brass candlestick in years.'

The tiny interior of the shop was in fact uncomfortablyfull, but there was almost nothing in it of the slightest val-ue. The floorspace was very restricted, because all roundthe walls were stacked innumerable dusty picture-frames.In the window there were trays of nuts and bolts, worn-outchisels, penknives with broken blades, tarnished watchesthat did not even pretend to be in going order, and othermiscellaneous rubbish. Only on a small table in the cornerwas there a litter of odds and ends—lacquered snuffbox-es, agate brooches, and the like—which looked as thoughthey might include something interesting. As Winstonwandered towards the table his eye was caught by a round,smooth thing that gleamed softly in the lamplight, and hepicked it up.

It was a heavy lump of glass, curved on one side, flaton the other, making almost a hemisphere. There was apeculiar softness, as of rainwater, in both the colour andthe texture of the glass. At the heart of it, magnified by thecurved surface, there was a strange, pink, convoluted objectthat recalled a rose or a sea anemone.

'What is it?' said Winston, fascinated.

'That's coral, that is,' said the old man. 'It must have comefrom the Indian Ocean. They used to kind of embed it inthe glass. That wasn't made less than a hundred years ago.More, by the look of it.'

'It's a beautiful thing,' said Winston.

'It is a beautiful thing,' said the other appreciatively. 'Butthere's not many that'd say so nowadays.' He coughed. 'Now,

1984

if it so happened that you wanted to buy it, that'd cost youfour dollars. I can remember when a thing like that wouldhave fetched eight pounds, and eight pounds was—well, Ican't work it out, but it was a lot of money. But who caresabout genuine antiques nowadays—even the few that'sleft?'

Winston immediately paid over the four dollars and slidthe coveted thing into his pocket. What appealed to himabout it was not so much its beauty as the air it seemed topossess of belonging to an age quite different from the pres-ent one. The soft, rainwatery glass was not like any glass thathe had ever seen. The thing was doubly attractive becauseof its apparent uselessness, though he could guess that itmust once have been intended as a paperweight. It was veryheavy in his pocket, but fortunately it did not make muchof a bulge. It was a queer thing, even a compromising thing,for a Party member to have in his possession. Anything old,and for that matter anything beautiful, was always vaguelysuspect. The old man had grown noticeably more cheerfulafter receiving the four dollars. Winston realized that hewould have accepted three or even two.

"There's another room upstairs that you might care totake a look at,' he said. 'There's not much in it. Just a fewpieces. We'll do with a light if we're going upstairs.'

He lit another lamp, and, with bowed back, led the wayslowly up the steep and worn stairs and along a tiny passage,into a room which did not give on the street but looked outon a cobbled yard and a forest of chimney-pots. Winstonnoticed that the furniture was still arranged as though the

room were meant to be lived in. There was a strip of car-pet on the floor, a picture or two on the walls, and a deep,slatternly arm-chair drawn up to the fireplace. An old-fash-ioned glass clock with a twelve-hour face was ticking awayon the mantelpiece. Under the window, and occupyingnearly a quarter of the room, was an enormous bed withthe mattress still on it.

'We lived here till my wife died,' said the old man halfapologetically. 'I'm selling the furniture off by little andlittle. Now that's a beautiful mahogany bed, or at least itwould be if you could get the bugs out of it. But I dare sayyou'd find it a little bit cumbersome.'

He was holding the lamp high up, so as to illuminate thewhole room, and in the warm dim light the place lookedcuriously inviting. The thought flitted through Winston'smind that it would probably be quite easy to rent the roomfor a few dollars a week, if he dared to take the risk. It was awild, impossible notion, to be abandoned as soon as thoughtof; but the room had awakened in him a sort of nostalgia, asort of ancestral memory. It seemed to him that he knewexactly what it felt like to sit in a room like this, in an arm-chair beside an open fire with your feet in the fender and akettle on the hob; utterly alone, utterly secure, with nobodywatching you, no voice pursuing you, no sound except thesinging of the kettle and the friendly ticking of the clock.

'There's no telescreen!' he could not help murmuring.

'Ah,' said the old man, 'I never had one of those things.Too expensive. And I never seemed to feel the need of it,somehow. Now that's a nice gateleg table in the corner there.

1984

Though of course you'd have to put new hinges on it if youwanted to use the flaps.'

There was a small bookcase in the other corner, andWinston had already gravitated towards it. It containednothing but rubbish. The hunting-down and destruction ofbooks had been done with the same thoroughness in theprole quarters as everywhere else. It was very unlikely thatthere existed anywhere in Oceania a copy of a book printedearlier than 1960. The old man, still carrying the lamp, wasstanding in front of a picture in a rosewood frame whichhung on the other side of the fireplace, opposite the bed.

'Now, if you happen to be interested in old prints at all——' he began delicately.

Winston came across to examine the picture. It was asteel engraving of an oval building with rectangular win-dows, and a small tower in front. There was a railingrunning round the building, and at the rear end there waswhat appeared to be a statue. Winston gazed at it for somemoments. It seemed vaguely familiar, though he did not re-member the statue.

'The frame's fixed to the wall,' said the old man, 'but Icould unscrew it for you, I dare say'

'I know that building,' said Winston finally 'It's a ruinnow. It's in the middle of the street outside the Palace ofJustice.'

"That's right. Outside the Law Courts. It was bombed in—oh, many years ago. It was a church at one time, St ClementDanes, its name was.' He smiled apologetically, as thoughconscious of saying something slightly ridiculous, and add-

ed: 'Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's!'

'What's that?' said Winston.

'Oh—'Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's.'That was a rhyme we had when I was a little boy. How it goeson I don't remember, but I do know it ended up, 'Here comesa candle to light you to bed, Here comes a chopper to chopoff your head.' It was a kind of a dance. They held out theirarms for you to pass under, and when they came to 'Herecomes a chopper to chop off your head' they brought theirarms down and caught you. It was just names of churches.All the London churches were in it—all the principal ones,that is.'

Winston wondered vaguely to what century the churchbelonged. It was always difficult to determine the age of aLondon building. Anything large and impressive, if it wasreasonably new in appearance, was automatically claimedas having been built since the Revolution, while anythingthat was obviously of earlier date was ascribed to some dimperiod called the Middle Ages. The centuries of capitalismwere held to have produced nothing of any value. One couldnot learn history from architecture any more than onecould learn it from books. Statues, inscriptions, memori-al stones, the names of streets—anything that might throwlight upon the past had been systematically altered.

'I never knew it had been a church,' he said.

'There's a lot of them left, really' said the old man, 'thoughthey've been put to other uses. Now, how did that rhyme go?Ah! I've got it!

'Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's, You

there, now, that's as far as I can get. A farthing, that wasa small copper coin, looked something like a cent.'

'Where was St Martin's?' said Winston.

'St Martin's? That's still standing. It's in Victory Square,alongside the picture gallery. A building with a kind of a tri-angular porch and pillars in front, and a big flight of steps.'

Winston knew the place well. It was a museum usedfor propaganda displays of various kinds—scale models ofrocket bombs and Floating Fortresses, waxwork tableaux il-lustrating enemy atrocities, and the like.

'St Martin's-in-the-Fields it used to be called,' supple-mented the old man, 'though I don't recollect any fieldsanywhere in those parts.'

Winston did not buy the picture. It would have been aneven more incongruous possession than the glass paper-weight, and impossible to carry home, unless it were takenout of its frame. But he lingered for some minutes more,talking to the old man, whose name, he discovered, was notWeeks—as one might have gathered from the inscriptionover the shop-front—but Charrington. Mr Charrington, itseemed, was a widower aged sixty-three and had inhabit-ed this shop for thirty years. Throughout that time he hadbeen intending to alter the name over the window, but hadnever quite got to the point of doing it. All the while thatthey were talking the half-remembered rhyme kept run-ning through Winston's head. Oranges and lemons say thebells of St Clement's, You owe me three farthings, say thebells of St Martin's! It was curious, but when you said it to

yourself you had the illusion of actually hearing bells, thebells of a lost London that still existed somewhere or other,disguised and forgotten. From one ghostly steeple after an-other he seemed to hear them pealing forth. Yet so far ashe could remember he had never in real life heard churchbells ringing.

He got away from Mr Charrington and went down thestairs alone, so as not to let the old man see him recon-noitring the street before stepping out of the door. He hadalready made up his mind that after a suitable interval—amonth, say—he would take the risk of visiting the shopagain. It was perhaps not more dangerous than shirking anevening at the Centre. The serious piece of folly had been tocome back here in the first place, after buying the diary andwithout knowing whether the proprietor of the shop couldbe trusted. However !

Yes, he thought again, he would come back. He wouldbuy further scraps of beautiful rubbish. He would buy theengraving of St Clement Danes, take it out of its frame, andcarry it home concealed under the jacket of his overalls. Hewould drag the rest of that poem out of Mr Charrington'smemory. Even the lunatic project of renting the room up-stairs flashed momentarily through his mind again. Forperhaps five seconds exaltation made him careless, and hestepped out on to the pavement without so much as a pre-liminary glance through the window. He had even startedhumming to an improvised tune

Suddenly his heart seemed to turn to ice and his bow-els to water. A figure in blue overalls was coming downthe pavement, not ten metres away. It was the girl from theFiction Department, the girl with dark hair. The light wasfailing, but there was no difficulty in recognizing her. Shelooked him straight in the face, then walked quickly on asthough she had not seen him.

For a few seconds Winston was too paralysed to move.Then he turned to the right and walked heavily away, notnoticing for the moment that he was going in the wrongdirection. At any rate, one question was settled. There wasno doubting any longer that the girl was spying on him. Shemust have followed him here, because it was not crediblethat by pure chance she should have happened to be walk-ing on the same evening up the same obscure backstreet,kilometres distant from any quarter where Party memberslived. It was too great a coincidence. Whether she was reallyan agent of the Thought Police, or simply an amateur spyactuated by officiousness, hardly mattered. It was enoughthat she was watching him. Probably she had seen him gointo the pub as well.

It was an effort to walk. The lump of glass in his pocketbanged against his thigh at each step, and he was half mind-ed to take it out and throw it away. The worst thing was thepain in his belly. For a couple of minutes he had the feelingthat he would die if he did not reach a lavatory soon. Butthere would be no public lavatories in a quarter like this.Then the spasm passed, leaving a dull ache behind.

The street was a blind alley. Winston halted, stood

for several seconds wondering vaguely what to do, thenturned round and began to retrace his steps. As he turnedit occurred to him that the girl had only passed him threeminutes ago and that by running he could probably catchup with her. He could keep on her track till they were insome quiet place, and then smash her skull in with a cob-blestone. The piece of glass in his pocket would be heavyenough for the job. But he abandoned the idea immediately,because even the thought of making any physical effort wasunbearable. He could not run, he could not strike a blow.Besides, she was young and lusty and would defend herself.He thought also of hurrying to the Community Centre andstaying there till the place closed, so as to establish a partialalibi for the evening. But that too was impossible. A deadlylassitude had taken hold of him. All he wanted was to gethome quickly and then sit down and be quiet.

It was after twenty-two hours when he got back to theflat. The lights would be switched off at the main at twenty-three thirty. He went into the kitchen and swallowed nearlya teacupful of Victory Gin. Then he went to the table in thealcove, sat down, and took the diary out of the drawer. Buthe did not open it at once. From the telescreen a brassy fe-male voice was squalling a patriotic song. He sat staring atthe marbled cover of the book, trying without success toshut the voice out of his consciousness.

It was at night that they came for you, always at night. Theproper thing was to kill yourself before they got you. Un-doubtedly some people did so. Many of the disappearanceswere actually suicides. But it needed desperate courage to

1984

kill yourself in a world where firearms, or any quick andcertain poison, were completely unprocurable. He thoughtwith a kind of astonishment of the biological uselessnessof pain and fear, the treachery of the human body whichalways freezes into inertia at exactly the moment when aspecial effort is needed. He might have silenced the dark-haired girl if only he had acted quickly enough: but preciselybecause of the extremity of his danger he had lost the powerto act. It struck him that in moments of crisis one is nev-er fighting against an external enemy, but always againstone's own body. Even now, in spite of the gin, the dull achein his belly made consecutive thought impossible. And itis the same, he perceived, in all seemingly heroic or trag-ic situations. On the battlefield, in the torture chamber, ona sinking ship, the issues that you are fighting for are al-ways forgotten, because the body swells up until it fills theuniverse, and even when you are not paralysed by fright orscreaming with pain, life is a moment-to-moment struggleagainst hunger or cold or sleeplessness, against a sour stom-ach or an aching tooth.

He opened the diary. It was important to write some-thing down. The woman on the telescreen had started a newsong. Her voice seemed to stick into his brain like jaggedsplinters of glass. He tried to think of O'Brien, for whom,or to whom, the diary was written, but instead he beganthinking of the things that would happen to him after theThought Police took him away. It would not matter if theykilled you at once. To be killed was what you expected. Butbefore death (nobody spoke of such things, yet everybody

knew of them) there was the routine of confession that hadto be gone through: the grovelling on the floor and scream-ing for mercy, the crack of broken bones, the smashed teeth,and bloody clots of hair.

Why did you have to endure it, since the end was al-ways the same? Why was it not possible to cut a few daysor weeks out of your life? Nobody ever escaped detection,and nobody ever failed to confess. When once you had suc-cumbed to thoughtcrime it was certain that by a given dateyou would be dead. Why then did that horror, which alterednothing, have to lie embedded in future time?

He tried with a little more success than before to sum-mon up the image of O'Brien. 'We shall meet in the placewhere there is no darkness,' O'Brien had said to him. Heknew what it meant, or thought he knew. The place wherethere is no darkness was the imagined future, which onewould never see, but which, by foreknowledge, one couldmystically share in. But with the voice from the telescreennagging at his ears he could not follow the train of thoughtfurther. He put a cigarette in his mouth. Half the tobaccopromptly fell out on to his tongue, a bitter dust which wasdifficult to spit out again. The face of Big Brother swam intohis mind, displacing that of O'Brien. Just as he had done afew days earlier, he slid a coin out of his pocket and lookedat it. The face gazed up at him, heavy, calm, protecting: butwhat kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache?Like a leaden knell the words came back at him:

Chapter i

It was the middle of the morning, and Winston had leftthe cubicle to go to the lavatory.

A solitary figure was coming towards him from the oth-er end of the long, brightly-lit corridor. It was the girl withdark hair. Four days had gone past since the evening whenhe had run into her outside the junk-shop. As she camenearer he saw that her right arm was in a sling, not notice-able at a distance because it was of the same colour as heroveralls. Probably she had crushed her hand while swing-ing round one of the big kaleidoscopes on which the plotsof novels were 'roughed in'. It was a common accident in theFiction Department.

They were perhaps four metres apart when the girl stum-bled and fell almost flat on her face. A sharp cry of pain waswrung out of her. She must have fallen right on the injuredarm. Winston stopped short. The girl had risen to her knees.Her face had turned a milky yellow colour against whichher mouth stood out redder than ever. Her eyes were fixedon his, with an appealing expression that looked more likefear than pain.

A curious emotion stirred in Winston's heart. In front ofhim was an enemy who was trying to kill him: in front ofhim, also, was a human creature, in pain and perhaps witha broken bone. Already he had instinctively started forward

to help her. In the moment when he had seen her fall on thebandaged arm, it had been as though he felt the pain in hisown body.

'You're hurt?' he said.

'It's nothing. My arm. It'll be all right in a second.'

She spoke as though her heart were fluttering. She hadcertainly turned very pale.

'You haven't broken anything?'

'No, I'm all right. It hurt for a moment, that's all.'

She held out her free hand to him, and he helped her up.She had regained some of her colour, and appeared verymuch better.

'It's nothing,' she repeated shortly. 'I only gave my wrist abit of a bang. Thanks, comrade!'

And with that she walked on in the direction in whichshe had been going, as briskly as though it had really beennothing. The whole incident could not have taken as muchas half a minute. Not to let one's feelings appear in one'sface was a habit that had acquired the status of an instinct,and in any case they had been standing straight in front ofa telescreen when the thing happened. Nevertheless it hadbeen very difficult not to betray a momentary surprise, forin the two or three seconds while he was helping her upthe girl had slipped something into his hand. There was noquestion that she had done it intentionally. It was some-thing small and flat. As he passed through the lavatory doorhe transferred it to his pocket and felt it with the tips of hisfingers. It was a scrap of paper folded into a square.

While he stood at the urinal he managed, with a little

1984

more fingering, to get it unfolded. Obviously there must bea message of some kind written on it. For a moment he wastempted to take it into one of the water-closets and read itat once. But that would be shocking folly, as he well knew.There was no place where you could be more certain thatthe telescreens were watched continuously

He went back to his cubicle, sat down, threw the frag-ment of paper casually among the other papers on the desk,put on his spectacles and hitched the speakwrite towardshim. 'Five minutes,' he told himself, 'five minutes at thevery least!' His heart bumped in his breast with frighteningloudness. Fortunately the piece of work he was engaged onwas mere routine, the rectification of a long list of figures,not needing close attention.

Whatever was written on the paper, it must have somekind of political meaning. So far as he could see there weretwo possibilities. One, much the more likely, was that thegirl was an agent of the Thought Police, just as he had feared.He did not know why the Thought Police should choose todeliver their messages in such a fashion, but perhaps theyhad their reasons. The thing that was written on the papermight be a threat, a summons, an order to commit suicide,a trap of some description. But there was another, wilderpossibility that kept raising its head, though he tried vain-ly to suppress it. This was, that the message did not comefrom the Thought Police at all, but from some kind of un-derground organization. Perhaps the Brotherhood existedafter all! Perhaps the girl was part of it! No doubt the ideawas absurd, but it had sprung into his mind in the very in-

stant of feeling the scrap of paper in his hand. It was not tilla couple of minutes later that the other, more probable ex-planation had occurred to him. And even now, though hisintellect told him that the message probably meant death—still, that was not what he believed, and the unreasonablehope persisted, and his heart banged, and it was with diffi-culty that he kept his voice from trembling as he murmuredhis figures into the speakwrite.

He rolled up the completed bundle of work and slid itinto the pneumatic tube. Eight minutes had gone by. He re-adjusted his spectacles on his nose, sighed, and drew thenext batch of work towards him, with the scrap of paper ontop of it. He flattened it out. On it was written, in a large un-formed handwriting:

I LOVE YOU.

For several seconds he was too stunned even to throwthe incriminating thing into the memory hole. When hedid so, although he knew very well the danger of showingtoo much interest, he could not resist reading it once again,just to make sure that the words were really there.

For the rest of the morning it was very difficult to work.What was even worse than having to focus his mind on aseries of niggling jobs was the need to conceal his agitationfrom the telescreen. He felt as though a fire were burningin his belly. Lunch in the hot, crowded, noise-filled canteenwas torment. He had hoped to be alone for a little whileduring the lunch hour, but as bad luck would have it the

imbecile Parsons flopped down beside him, the tang of hissweat almost defeating the tinny smell of stew, and kept upa stream of talk about the preparations for Hate Week. Hewas particularly enthusiastic about a papier-mache model ofBig Brother's head, two metres wide, which was being madefor the occasion by his daughter's troop of Spies. The irri-tating thing was that in the racket of voices Winston couldhardly hear what Parsons was saying, and was constantlyhaving to ask for some fatuous remark to be repeated. Justonce he caught a glimpse of the girl, at a table with two oth-er girls at the far end of the room. She appeared not to haveseen him, and he did not look in that direction again.

The afternoon was morebearable. Immediately after lunchthere arrived a delicate, difficult piece of work which wouldtake several hours and necessitated putting everything elseaside. It consisted in falsifying a series of production re-ports of two years ago, in such a way as to cast discredit on aprominent member of the Inner Party, who was now undera cloud. This was the kind of thing that Winston was goodat, and for more than two hours he succeeded in shuttingthe girl out of his mind altogether. Then the memory of herface came back, and with it a raging, intolerable desire tobe alone. Until he could be alone it was impossible to thinkthis new development out. Tonight was one of his nights atthe Community Centre. He wolfed another tasteless mealin the canteen, hurried off to the Centre, took part in thesolemn foolery of a 'discussion group', played two gamesof table tennis, swallowed several glasses of gin, and sat forhalf an hour through a lecture entitled Tngsoc in relation to

chess'. His soul writhed with boredom, but for once he hadhad no impulse to shirk his evening at the Centre. At thesight of the words I LOVE YOU the desire to stay alive hadwelled up in him, and the taking of minor risks suddenlyseemed stupid. It was not till twenty-three hours, when hewas home and in bed—in the darkness, where you were safeeven from the telescreen so long as you kept silent—that hewas able to think continuously.

It was a physical problem that had to be solved: how toget in touch with the girl and arrange a meeting. He didnot consider any longer the possibility that she might belaying some kind of trap for him. He knew that it was notso, because of her unmistakable agitation when she handedhim the note. Obviously she had been frightened out of herwits, as well she might be. Nor did the idea of refusing heradvances even cross his mind. Only five nights ago he hadcontemplated smashing her skull in with a cobblestone, butthat was of no importance. He thought of her naked, youth-ful body, as he had seen it in his dream. He had imaginedher a fool like all the rest of them, her head stuffed with liesand hatred, her belly full of ice. A kind of fever seized him atthe thought that he might lose her, the white youthful bodymight slip away from him! What he feared more than any-thing else was that she would simply change her mind if hedid not get in touch with her quickly. But the physical dif-ficulty of meeting was enormous. It was like trying to makea move at chess when you were already mated. Whicheverway you turned, the telescreen faced you. Actually, all thepossible ways of communicating with her had occurred to

him within five minutes of reading the note; but now, withtime to think, he went over them one by one, as though lay-ing out a row of instruments on a table.

Obviously the kind of encounter that had happened thismorning could not be repeated. If she had worked in the Re-cords Department it might have been comparatively simple,but he had only a very dim idea whereabouts in the buildingthe Fiction Department lay, and he had no pretext for goingthere. If he had known where she lived, and at what timeshe left work, he could have contrived to meet her some-where on her way home; but to try to follow her home wasnot safe, because it would mean loitering about outside theMinistry, which was bound to be noticed. As for sendinga letter through the mails, it was out of the question. Bya routine that was not even secret, all letters were openedin transit. Actually, few people ever wrote letters. For themessages that it was occasionally necessary to send, therewere printed postcards with long lists of phrases, and youstruck out the ones that were inapplicable. In any case hedid not know the girl's name, let alone her address. Final-ly he decided that the safest place was the canteen. If hecould get her at a table by herself, somewhere in the middleof the room, not too near the telescreens, and with a suf-ficient buzz of conversation all round—if these conditionsendured for, say, thirty seconds, it might be possible to ex-change a few words.

For a week after this, life was like a restless dream. Onthe next day she did not appear in the canteen until hewas leaving it, the whistle having already blown. Presum-

ably she had been changed on to a later shift. They passedeach other without a glance. On the day after that she wasin the canteen at the usual time, but with three other girlsand immediately under a telescreen. Then for three dread-ful days she did not appear at all. His whole mind and bodyseemed to be afflicted with an unbearable sensitivity, a sortof transparency, which made every movement, every sound,every contact, every word that he had to speak or listento, an agony. Even in sleep he could not altogether escapefrom her image. He did not touch the diary during thosedays. If there was any relief, it was in his work, in which hecould sometimes forget himself for ten minutes at a stretch.He had absolutely no clue as to what had happened to her.There was no enquiry he could make. She might have beenvaporized, she might have committed suicide, she mighthave been transferred to the other end of Oceania: worstand likeliest of all, she might simply have changed her mindand decided to avoid him.

The next day she reappeared. Her arm was out of the slingand she had a band of sticking-plaster round her wrist. Therelief of seeing her was so great that he could not resist star-ing directly at her for several seconds. On the following dayhe very nearly succeeded in speaking to her. When he cameinto the canteen she was sitting at a table well out from thewall, and was quite alone. It was early, and the place wasnot very full. The queue edged forward till Winston wasalmost at the counter, then was held up for two minutesbecause someone in front was complaining that he had notreceived his tablet of saccharine. But the girl was still alone

1984

when Winston secured his tray and began to make for hertable. He walked casually towards her, his eyes searchingfor a place at some table beyond her. She was perhaps threemetres away from him. Another two seconds would do it.Then a voice behind him called, 'Smith!' He pretended notto hear. 'Smith!' repeated the voice, more loudly. It was nouse. He turned round. A blond-headed, silly-faced youngman named Wilsher, whom he barely knew, was invitinghim with a smile to a vacant place at his table. It was notsafe to refuse. After having been recognized, he could notgo and sit at a table with an unattended girl. It was too no-ticeable. He sat down with a friendly smile. The silly blondface beamed into his. Winston had a hallucination of him-self smashing a pick-axe right into the middle of it. Thegirl's table filled up a few minutes later.

But she must have seen him coming towards her, andperhaps she would take the hint. Next day he took care toarrive early. Surely enough, she was at a table in about thesame place, and again alone. The person immediately aheadof him in the queue was a small, swiftly-moving, beetle-likeman with a flat face and tiny, suspicious eyes. As Winstonturned away from the counter with his tray, he saw that thelittle man was making straight for the girl's table. His hopessank again. There was a vacant place at a table further away,but something in the little man's appearance suggestedthat he would be sufficiently attentive to his own comfortto choose the emptiest table. With ice at his heart Winstonfollowed. It was no use unless he could get the girl alone.At this moment there was a tremendous crash. The little

man was sprawling on all fours, his tray had gone flying,two streams of soup and coffee were flowing across the floor.He started to his feet with a malignant glance at Winston,whom he evidently suspected of having tripped him up. Butit was all right. Five seconds later, with a thundering heart,Winston was sitting at the girl's table.

He did not look at her. He unpacked his tray and prompt-ly began eating. It was all-important to speak at once,before anyone else came, but now a terrible fear had takenpossession of him. A week had gone by since she had firstapproached him. She would have changed her mind, shemust have changed her mind! It was impossible that this af-fair should end successfully; such things did not happen inreal life. He might have flinched altogether from speaking ifat this moment he had not seen Ampleforth, the hairy-earedpoet, wandering limply round the room with a tray, look-ing for a place to sit down. In his vague way Ampleforthwas attached to Winston, and would certainly sit down athis table if he caught sight of him. There was perhaps a min-ute in which to act. Both Winston and the girl were eatingsteadily. The stuff they were eating was a thin stew, actuallya soup, of haricot beans. In a low murmur Winston beganspeaking. Neither of them looked up; steadily they spoonedthe watery stuff into their mouths, and between spoonfulsexchanged the few necessary words in low expressionlessvoices.

'What time do you leave work?'

'Eighteen-thirty'

'Where can we meet?'

1984

'Victory Square, near the monument.'

'It's full of telescreens.'

'It doesn't matter if there's a crowd.'

'Any signal?'

'No. Don't come up to me until you see me among a lotof people. And don't look at me. Just keep somewhere nearme.'

'What time?'

'Nineteen hours.'

All right.'

Ampleforth failed to see Winston and sat down at an-other table. They did not speak again, and, so far as it waspossible for two people sitting on opposite sides of the sametable, they did not look at one another. The girl finished herlunch quickly and made off, while Winston stayed to smokea cigarette.

Winston was in Victory Square before the appointedtime. He wandered round the base of the enormous flut-ed column, at the top of which Big Brother's statue gazedsouthward towards the skies where he had vanquished theEurasian aeroplanes (the Eastasian aeroplanes, it had been,a few years ago) in the Battle of Airstrip One. In the streetin front of it there was a statue of a man on horseback whichwas supposed to represent Oliver Cromwell. At five minutespast the hour the girl had still not appeared. Again the ter-rible fear seized upon Winston. She was not coming, shehad changed her mind! He walked slowly up to the northside of the square and got a sort of pale-coloured pleasurefrom identifying St Martin's Church, whose bells, when it

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 143

had bells, had chimed 'You owe me three farthings.' Thenhe saw the girl standing at the base of the monument, read-ing or pretending to read a poster which ran spirally up thecolumn. It was not safe to go near her until some more peo-ple had accumulated. There were telescreens all round thepediment. But at this moment there was a din of shoutingand a zoom of heavy vehicles from somewhere to the left.Suddenly everyone seemed to be running across the square.The girl nipped nimbly round the lions at the base of themonument and joined in the rush. Winston followed. As heran, he gathered from some shouted remarks that a convoyof Eurasian prisoners was passing.

Already a dense mass of people was blocking the southside of the square. Winston, at normal times the kind ofperson who gravitates to the outer edge of any kind ofscrimmage, shoved, butted, squirmed his way forward intothe heart of the crowd. Soon he was within arm's length ofthe girl, but the way was blocked by an enormous prole andan almost equally enormous woman, presumably his wife,who seemed to form an impenetrable wall of flesh. Winstonwriggled himself sideways, and with a violent lunge man-aged to drive his shoulder between them. For a moment itfelt as though his entrails were being ground to pulp be-tween the two muscular hips, then he had broken through,sweating a little. He was next to the girl. They were shoulderto shoulder, both staring fixedly in front of them.

A long line of trucks, with wooden-faced guards armedwith sub-machine guns standing upright in each corner, waspassing slowly down the street. In the trucks little yellow

1984

men in shabby greenish uniforms were squatting, jammedclose together. Their sad, Mongolian faces gazed out overthe sides of the trucks utterly incurious. Occasionally whena truck jolted there was a clank-clank of metal: all the pris-oners were wearing leg-irons. Truck-load after truck-load ofthe sad faces passed. Winston knew they were there but hesaw them only intermittently. The girl's shoulder, and herarm right down to the elbow, were pressed against his. Hercheek was almost near enough for him to feel its warmth.She had immediately taken charge of the situation, just asshe had done in the canteen. She began speaking in thesame expressionless voice as before, with lips barely mov-ing, a mere murmur easily drowned by the din of voices andthe rumbling of the trucks.

'Can you hear me?'

'Yes.'

'Can you get Sunday afternoon off?'

'Yes.'

'Then listen carefully. You'll have to remember this. Goto Paddington Station '

With a sort of military precision that astonished him, sheoutlined the route that he was to follow. A half-hour railwayjourney; turn left outside the station; two kilometres alongthe road; a gate with the top bar missing; a path across afield; a grass-grown lane; a track between bushes; a deadtree with moss on it. It was as though she had a map insideher head. 'Can you remember all that?' she murmured fi-nally

'Yes.'

'You turn left, then right, then left again. And the gate'sgot no top bar.'

'Yes. What time?'

'About fifteen. You may have to wait. I'll get there by an-other way. Are you sure you remember everything?'

'Yes.'

"Then get away from me as quick as you can.'

She need not have told him that. But for the momentthey could not extricate themselves from the crowd. Thetrucks were still filing past, the people still insatiably gap-ing. At the start there had been a few boos and hisses, butit came only from the Party members among the crowd,and had soon stopped. The prevailing emotion was simplycuriosity. Foreigners, whether from Eurasia or from Easta-sia, were a kind of strange animal. One literally never sawthem except in the guise of prisoners, and even as prison-ers one never got more than a momentary glimpse of them.Nor did one know what became of them, apart from thefew who were hanged as war-criminals: the others simplyvanished, presumably into forced-labour camps. The roundMogol faces had given way to faces of a more European type,dirty, bearded and exhausted. From over scrubby cheek-bones eyes looked into Winston's, sometimes with strangeintensity, and flashed away again. The convoy was drawingto an end. In the last truck he could see an aged man, hisface a mass of grizzled hair, standing upright with wristscrossed in front of him, as though he were used to havingthem bound together. It was almost time for Winston andthe girl to part. But at the last moment, while the crowd still

146 1984

hemmed them in, her hand felt for his and gave it a fleetingsqueeze.

It could not have been ten seconds, and yet it seemed along time that their hands were clasped together. He hadtime to learn every detail of her hand. He explored the longfingers, the shapely nails, the work-hardened palm with itsrow of callouses, the smooth flesh under the wrist. Merelyfrom feeling it he would have known it by sight. In the sameinstant it occurred to him that he did not know what colourthe girl's eyes were. They were probably brown, but peoplewith dark hair sometimes had blue eyes. To turn his headand look at her would have been inconceivable folly. Withhands locked together, invisible among the press of bodies,they stared steadily in front of them, and instead of the eyesof the girl, the eyes of the aged prisoner gazed mournfullyat Winston out of nests of hair.

Chapter 2

Winston picked his way up the lane through dappledlight and shade, stepping out into pools of gold wher-ever the boughs parted. Under the trees to the left of himthe ground was misty with bluebells. The air seemed to kissone's skin. It was the second of May. From somewhere deep-er in the heart of the wood came the droning of ring doves.He was a bit early. There had been no difficulties aboutthe journey, and the girl was so evidently experienced thathe was less frightened than he would normally have been.Presumably she could be trusted to find a safe place. Ingeneral you could not assume that you were much safer inthe country than in London. There were no telescreens, ofcourse, but there was always the danger of concealed mi-crophones by which your voice might be picked up andrecognized; besides, it was not easy to make a journey byyourself without attracting attention. For distances of lessthan 100 kilometres it was not necessary to get your pass-port endorsed, but sometimes there were patrols hangingabout the railway stations, who examined the papers of anyParty member they found there and asked awkward ques-tions. However, no patrols had appeared, and on the walkfrom the station he had made sure by cautious backwardglances that he was not being followed. The train was fullof proles, in holiday mood because of the summery weather.

148 1984

The wooden-seated carriage in which he travelled was filledto overflowing by a single enormous family, ranging froma toothless great-grandmother to a month-old baby, goingout to spend an afternoon with 'in-laws' in the country, and,as they freely explained to Winston, to get hold of a littleblackmarket butter.

The lane widened, and in a minute he came to the foot-path she had told him of, a mere cattle-track which plungedbetween the bushes. He had no watch, but it could not befifteen yet. The bluebells were so thick underfoot that it wasimpossible not to tread on them. He knelt down and beganpicking some partly to pass the time away, but also froma vague idea that he would like to have a bunch of flowersto offer to the girl when they met. He had got together abig bunch and was smelling their faint sickly scent when asound at his back froze him, the unmistakable crackle of afoot on twigs. He went on picking bluebells. It was the bestthing to do. It might be the girl, or he might have been fol-lowed after all. To look round was to show guilt. He pickedanother and another. A hand fell lightly on his shoulder.

He looked up. It was the girl. She shook her head, evi-dently as a warning that he must keep silent, then partedthe bushes and quickly led the way along the narrow trackinto the wood. Obviously she had been that way before, forshe dodged the boggy bits as though by habit. Winston fol-lowed, still clasping his bunch of flowers. His first feelingwas relief, but as he watched the strong slender body mov-ing in front of him, with the scarlet sash that was just tightenough to bring out the curve of her hips, the sense of his

own inferiority was heavy upon him. Even now it seemedquite likely that when she turned round and looked at himshe would draw back after all. The sweetness of the air andthe greenness of the leaves daunted him. Already on thewalk from the station the May sunshine had made him feeldirty and etiolated, a creature of indoors, with the sootydust of London in the pores of his skin. It occurred to himthat till now she had probably never seen him in broad day-light in the open. They came to the fallen tree that she hadspoken of. The girl hopped over and forced apart the bush-es, in which there did not seem to be an opening. WhenWinston followed her, he found that they were in a naturalclearing, a tiny grassy knoll surrounded by tall saplings thatshut it in completely. The girl stopped and turned.

'Here we are,' she said.

He was facing her at several paces' distance. As yet he didnot dare move nearer to her.

T didn't want to say anything in the lane,' she went on,'in case there's a mike hidden there. I don't suppose there is,but there could be. There's always the chance of one of thoseswine recognizing your voice. We're all right here.'

He still had not the courage to approach her. 'We're allright here?' he repeated stupidly.

'Yes. Look at the trees.' They were small ashes, which atsome time had been cut down and had sprouted up againinto a forest of poles, none of them thicker than one's wrist.'There's nothing big enough to hide a mike in. Besides, I'vebeen here before.'

They were only making conversation. He had managed

1984

to move closer to her now. She stood before him very up-right, with a smile on her face that looked faintly ironical, asthough she were wondering why he was so slow to act. Thebluebells had cascaded on to the ground. They seemed tohave fallen of their own accord. He took her hand.

'Would you believe,' he said, 'that till this moment Ididn't know what colour your eyes were?' They were brown,he noted, a rather light shade of brown, with dark lashes.'Now that you've seen what I'm really like, can you still bearto look at me?'

'Yes, easily'

'I'm thirty-nine years old. I've got a wife that I can't getrid of. I've got varicose veins. I've got five false teeth.'

T couldn't care less,' said the girl.

The next moment, it was hard to say by whose act, she wasin his his arms. At the beginning he had no feeling exceptsheer incredulity. The youthful body was strained againsthis own, the mass of dark hair was against his face, and yes!actually she had turned her face up and he was kissing thewide red mouth. She had clasped her arms about his neck,she was calling him darling, precious one, loved one. Hehad pulled her down on to the ground, she was utterly un-resisting, he could do what he liked with her. But the truthwas that he had no physical sensation, except that of merecontact. All he felt was incredulity and pride. He was gladthat this was happening, but he had no physical desire. Itwas too soon, her youth and prettiness had frightened him,he was too much used to living without women—he didnot know the reason. The girl picked herself up and pulled

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 151

a bluebell out of her hair. She sat against him, putting herarm round his waist.

'Never mind, dear. There's no hurry. We've got the wholeafternoon. Isn't this a splendid hide-out? I found it when Igot lost once on a community hike. If anyone was comingyou could hear them a hundred metres away'

'What is your name?' said Winston.

'Julia. I know yours. It's Winston—Winston Smith.'

'How did you find that out?'

'I expect I'm better at finding things out than you are,dear. Tell me, what did you think of me before that day Igave you the note?'

He did not feel any temptation to tell lies to her. It waseven a sort of love-offering to start off by telling the worst.

'I hated the sight of you,' he said. 'I wanted to rape youand then murder you afterwards. Two weeks ago I thoughtseriously of smashing your head in with a cobblestone. Ifyou really want to know, I imagined that you had some-thing to do with the Thought Police.'

The girl laughed delightedly, evidently taking this as atribute to the excellence of her disguise.

'Not the Thought Police! You didn't honestly think that?'

'Well, perhaps not exactly that. But from your generalappearance—merely because you're young and fresh andhealthy, you understand—I thought that probably '

'You thought I was a good Party member. Pure in wordand deed. Banners, processions, slogans, games, commu-nity hikes all that stuff. And you thought that if I had aquarter of a chance I'd denounce you as a thought-criminal

1984

and get you killed off?'

'Yes, something of that kind. A great many young girlsare like that, you know.'

'It's this bloody thing that does it,' she said, ripping offthe scarlet sash of the Junior Anti-Sex League and flingingit on to a bough. Then, as though touching her waist hadreminded her of something, she felt in the pocket of heroveralls and produced a small slab of chocolate. She brokeit in half and gave one of the pieces to Winston. Even be-fore he had taken it he knew by the smell that it was veryunusual chocolate. It was dark and shiny, and was wrappedin silver paper. Chocolate normally was dull-brown crum-bly stuff that tasted, as nearly as one could describe it, likethe smoke of a rubbish fire. But at some time or another hehad tasted chocolate like the piece she had given him. Thefirst whiff of its scent had stirred up some memory whichhe could not pin down, but which was powerful and trou-bling.

'Where did you get this stuff?' he said.

'Black market,' she said indifferently. Actually I am thatsort of girl, to look at. I'm good at games. I was a troop-lead-er in the Spies. I do voluntary work three evenings a weekfor the Junior Anti-Sex League. Hours and hours I've spentpasting their bloody rot all over London. I always carry oneend of a banner in the processions. I always look cheer-ful and I never shirk anything. Always yell with the crowd,that's what I say. It's the only way to be safe.'

The first fragment of chocolate had melted on Win-ston's tongue. The taste was delightful. But there was still

that memory moving round the edges of his consciousness,something strongly felt but not reducible to definite shape,like an object seen out of the corner of one's eye. He pushedit away from him, aware only that it was the memory ofsome action which he would have liked to undo but couldnot.

'You are very young,' he said. 'You are ten or fifteen yearsyounger than I am. What could you see to attract you in aman like me?'

'It was something in your face. I thought I'd take a chance.I'm good at spotting people who don't belong. As soon as Isaw you I knew you were against THEM.'

THEM, it appeared, meant the Party, and above all theInner Party, about whom she talked with an open jeeringhatred which made Winston feel uneasy, although he knewthat they were safe here if they could be safe anywhere. Athing that astonished him about her was the coarseness ofher language. Party members were supposed not to swear,and Winston himself very seldom did swear, aloud, at anyrate. Julia, however, seemed unable to mention the Party,and especially the Inner Party, without using the kind ofwords that you saw chalked up in dripping alley-ways. Hedid not dislike it. It was merely one symptom of her revoltagainst the Party and all its ways, and somehow it seemednatural and healthy, like the sneeze of a horse that smellsbad hay. They had left the clearing and were wanderingagain through the chequered shade, with their arms roundeach other's waists whenever it was wide enough to walktwo abreast. He noticed how much softer her waist seemed

1984

to feel now that the sash was gone. They did not speak abovea whisper. Outside the clearing, Julia said, it was better togo quietly. Presently they had reached the edge of the littlewood. She stopped him.

'Don't go out into the open. There might be someonewatching. We're all right if we keep behind the boughs.'

They were standing in the shade of hazel bushes. Thesunlight, filtering through innumerable leaves, was still hoton their faces. Winston looked out into the field beyond,and underwent a curious, slow shock of recognition. Heknew it by sight. An old, closebitten pasture, with a foot-path wandering across it and a molehill here and there. Inthe ragged hedge on the opposite side the boughs of the elmtrees swayed just perceptibly in the breeze, and their leavesstirred faintly in dense masses like women's hair. Surelysomewhere nearby, but out of sight, there must be a streamwith green pools where dace were swimming?

'Isn't there a stream somewhere near here?' he whis-pered.

"That's right, there is a stream. It's at the edge of the nextfield, actually. There are fish in it, great big ones. You canwatch them lying in the pools under the willow trees, wav-ing their tails.'

'It's the Golden Country—almost,' he murmured.

'The Golden Country?'

'It's nothing, really. A landscape I've seen sometimes ina dream.'

'Look!' whispered Julia.

A thrush had alighted on a bough not five metres away,

almost at the level of their faces. Perhaps it had not seenthem. It was in the sun, they in the shade. It spread out itswings, fitted them carefully into place again, ducked itshead for a moment, as though making a sort of obeisance tothe sun, and then began to pour forth a torrent of song. Inthe afternoon hush the volume of sound was startling. Win-ston and Julia clung together, fascinated. The music went onand on, minute after minute, with astonishing variations,never once repeating itself, almost as though the bird weredeliberately showing off its virtuosity. Sometimes it stoppedfor a few seconds, spread out and resettled its wings, thenswelled its speckled breast and again burst into song. Win-ston watched it with a sort of vague reverence. For whom, forwhat, was that bird singing? No mate, no rival was watch-ing it. What made it sit at the edge of the lonely wood andpour its music into nothingness? He wondered whether af-ter all there was a microphone hidden somewhere near. Heand Julia had spoken only in low whispers, and it would notpick up what they had said, but it would pick up the thrush.Perhaps at the other end of the instrument some small, bee-tle-like man was listening intently—listening to that. Butby degrees the flood of music drove all speculations out ofhis mind. It was as though it were a kind of liquid stuff thatpoured all over him and got mixed up with the sunlightthat filtered through the leaves. He stopped thinking andmerely felt. The girl's waist in the bend of his arm was softand warm. He pulled her round so that they were breastto breast; her body seemed to melt into his. Wherever hishands moved it was all as yielding as water. Their mouths

156 1984

clung together; it was quite different from the hard kissesthey had exchanged earlier. When they moved their facesapart again both of them sighed deeply. The bird took frightand fled with a clatter of wings.

Winston put his lips against her ear. 'NOW,' he whis-pered.

'Not here,' she whispered back. 'Come back to the hide-out. It's safer.'

Quickly, with an occasional crackle of twigs, theythreaded their way back to the clearing. When they wereonce inside the ring of saplings she turned and faced him.They were both breathing fast, but the smile had reappearedround the corners of her mouth. She stood looking at himfor an instant, then felt at the zipper of her overalls. And,yes! it was almost as in his dream. Almost as swiftly as hehad imagined it, she had torn her clothes off, and when sheflung them aside it was with that same magnificent gestureby which a whole civilization seemed to be annihilated. Herbody gleamed white in the sun. But for a moment he didnot look at her body; his eyes were anchored by the freckledface with its faint, bold smile. He knelt down before her andtook her hands in his.

'Have you done this before?'

'Of course. Hundreds of times—well, scores of times,anyway'

'With Party members?'

'Yes, always with Party members.'

'With members of the Inner Party?'

'Not with those swine, no. But there's plenty that WOULD

if they got half a chance. They're not so holy as they makeout.'

His heart leapt. Scores of times she had done it: he wishedit had been hundreds—thousands. Anything that hinted atcorruption always filled him with a wild hope. Who knew,perhaps the Party was rotten under the surface, its cult ofstrenuousness and self-denial simply a sham concealing in-iquity. If he could have infected the whole lot of them withleprosy or syphilis, how gladly he would have done so! Any-thing to rot, to weaken, to undermine! He pulled her downso that they were kneeling face to face.

'Listen. The more men you've had, the more I love you.Do you understand that?'

'Yes, perfectly'

'I hate purity, I hate goodness! I don't want any virtueto exist anywhere. I want everyone to be corrupt to thebones.'

'Well then, I ought to suit you, dear. I'm corrupt to thebones.'

'You like doing this? I don't mean simply me: I mean thething in itself?'

'I adore it.'

That was above all what he wanted to hear. Not merelythe love of one person but the animal instinct, the simpleundifferentiated desire: that was the force that would tearthe Party to pieces. He pressed her down upon the grass,among the fallen bluebells. This time there was no difficul-ty Presently the rising and falling of their breasts slowedto normal speed, and in a sort of pleasant helplessness they

1984

fell apart. The sun seemed to have grown hotter. They wereboth sleepy. He reached out for the discarded overalls andpulled them partly over her. Almost immediately they fellasleep and slept for about half an hour.

Winston woke first. He sat up and watched the freck-led face, still peacefully asleep, pillowed on the palm of herhand. Except for her mouth, you could not call her beauti-ful. There was a line or two round the eyes, if you lookedclosely. The short dark hair was extraordinarily thick andsoft. It occurred to him that he still did not know her sur-name or where she lived.

The young, strong body, now helpless in sleep, awoke inhim a pitying, protecting feeling. But the mindless tender-ness that he had felt under the hazel tree, while the thrushwas singing, had not quite come back. He pulled the over-alls aside and studied her smooth white flank. In the olddays, he thought, a man looked at a girl's body and saw thatit was desirable, and that was the end of the story. But youcould not have pure love or pure lust nowadays. No emo-tion was pure, because everything was mixed up with fearand hatred. Their embrace had been a battle, the climax avictory. It was a blow struck against the Party. It was a po-litical act.

^ We can come here once again,' said Julia. 'It's generally safeto use any hide-out twice. But not for another month ortwo, of course.'

As soon as she woke up her demeanour had changed. Shebecame alert and business-like, put her clothes on, knot-ted the scarlet sash about her waist, and began arrangingthe details of the journey home. It seemed natural to leavethis to her. She obviously had a practical cunning whichWinston lacked, and she seemed also to have an exhaus-tive knowledge of the countryside round London, storedaway from innumerable community hikes. The route shegave him was quite different from the one by which he hadcome, and brought him out at a different railway station.'Never go home the same way as you went out,' she said, asthough enunciating an important general principle. Shewould leave first, and Winston was to wait half an hour be-fore following her.

She had named a place where they could meet after work,four evenings hence. It was a street in one of the poorerquarters, where there was an open market which was gener-ally crowded and noisy. She would be hanging about amongthe stalls, pretending to be in search of shoelaces or sewing-thread. If she judged that the coast was clear she would blowher nose when he approached; otherwise he was to walk

1984

past her without recognition. But with luck, in the middleof the crowd, it would be safe to talk for a quarter of an hourand arrange another meeting.

'And now I must go,' she said as soon as he had masteredhis instructions. 'I'm due back at nineteen-thirty. I've got toput in two hours for the Junior Anti-Sex League, handingout leaflets, or something. Isn't it bloody? Give me a brush-down, would you? Have I got any twigs in my hair? Are yousure? Then good-bye, my love, good-bye!'

She flung herself into his arms, kissed him almost vi-olently, and a moment later pushed her way through thesaplings and disappeared into the wood with very littlenoise. Even now he had not found out her surname or heraddress. However, it made no difference, for it was incon-ceivable that they could ever meet indoors or exchange anykind of written communication.

As it happened, they never went back to the clearing inthe wood. During the month of May there was only onefurther occasion on which they actually succeeded in mak-ing love. That was in another hiding-place known to Julia,the belfry of a ruinous church in an almost-deserted stretchof country where an atomic bomb had fallen thirty yearsearlier. It was a good hiding-place when once you got there,but the getting there was very dangerous. For the rest theycould meet only in the streets, in a different place every eve-ning and never for more than half an hour at a time. In thestreet it was usually possible to talk, after a fashion. As theydrifted down the crowded pavements, not quite abreastand never looking at one another, they carried on a curi-

ous, intermittent conversation which flicked on and off likethe beams of a lighthouse, suddenly nipped into silence bythe approach of a Party uniform or the proximity of a tele-screen, then taken up again minutes later in the middle ofa sentence, then abruptly cut short as they parted at theagreed spot, then continued almost without introductionon the following day Julia appeared to be quite used to thiskind of conversation, which she called 'talking by instal-ments'. She was also surprisingly adept at speaking withoutmoving her lips. Just once in almost a month of nightlymeetings they managed to exchange a kiss. They were pass-ing in silence down a side-street (Julia would never speakwhen they were away from the main streets) when there wasa deafening roar, the earth heaved, and the air darkened,and Winston found himself lying on his side, bruised andterrified. A rocket bomb must have dropped quite near athand. Suddenly he became aware of Julia's face a few centi-metres from his own, deathly white, as white as chalk. Evenher lips were white. She was dead! He clasped her againsthim and found that he was kissing a live warm face. Butthere was some powdery stuff that got in the way of his lips.Both of their faces were thickly coated with plaster.

There were evenings when they reached their rendezvousand then had to walk past one another without a sign, be-cause a patrol had just come round the corner or a helicopterwas hovering overhead. Even if it had been less dangerous,it would still have been difficult to find time to meet. Win-ston's working week was sixty hours, Julia's was even longer,and their free days varied according to the pressure of work

1984

and did not often coincide. Julia, in any case, seldom had anevening completely free. She spent an astonishing amountof time in attending lectures and demonstrations, distrib-uting literature for the junior Anti-Sex League, preparingbanners for Hate Week, making collections for the savingscampaign, and such-like activities. It paid, she said, it wascamouflage. If you kept the small rules, you could break thebig ones. She even induced Winston to mortgage yet an-other of his evenings by enrolling himself for the part-timemunition work which was done voluntarily by zealous Par-ty members. So, one evening every week, Winston spentfour hours of paralysing boredom, screwing together smallbits of metal which were probably parts of bomb fuses, in adraughty, ill-lit workshop where the knocking of hammersmingled drearily with the music of the telescreens.

When they met in the church tower the gaps in theirfragmentary conversation were filled up. It was a blazing af-ternoon. The air in the little square chamber above the bellswas hot and stagnant, and smelt overpoweringly of pigeondung. They sat talking for hours on the dusty, twig-litteredfloor, one or other of them getting up from time to time tocast a glance through the arrowslits and make sure that noone was coming.

Julia was twenty-six years old. She lived in a hostel withthirty other girls ('Always in the stink of women! How Ihate women!' she said parenthetically), and she worked, ashe had guessed, on the novel-writing machines in the Fic-tion Department. She enjoyed her work, which consistedchiefly in running and servicing a powerful but tricky elec-

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 163

trie motor. She was 'not clever', but was fond of using herhands and felt at home with machinery. She could describethe whole process of composing a novel, from the generaldirective issued by the Planning Committee down to thefinal touching-up by the Rewrite Squad. But she was not in-terested in the finished product. She 'didn't much care forreading,' she said. Books were just a commodity that had tobe produced, like jam or bootlaces.

She had no memories of anything before the early six-ties and the only person she had ever known who talkedfrequently of the days before the Revolution was a grand-father who had disappeared when she was eight. At schoolshe had been captain of the hockey team and had won thegymnastics trophy two years running. She had been a troop-leader in the Spies and a branch secretary in the YouthLeague before joining the Junior Anti-Sex League. She hadalways borne an excellent character. She had even (an infal-lible mark of good reputation) been picked out to work inPornosec, the sub-section of the Fiction Department whichturned out cheap pornography for distribution among theproles. It was nicknamed Muck House by the people whoworked in it, she remarked. There she had remained for ayear, helping to produce booklets in sealed packets with ti-tles like 'Spanking Stories' or 'One Night in a Girls' School',to be bought furtively by proletarian youths who were un-der the impression that they were buying something illegal.

'What are these books like?' said Winston curiously.

'Oh, ghastly rubbish. They're boring, really. They onlyhave six plots, but they swap them round a bit. Of course

164 1984

I was only on the kaleidoscopes. I was never in the RewriteSquad. I'm not literary, dear—not even enough for that.'

He learned with astonishment that all the workers inPornosec, except the heads of the departments, were girls.The theory was that men, whose sex instincts were less con-trollable than those of women, were in greater danger ofbeing corrupted by the filth they handled.

"They don't even like having married women there,' sheadded. Girls are always supposed to be so pure. Here's onewho isn't, anyway.

She had had her first love-affair when she was sixteen,with a Party member of sixty who later committed suicideto avoid arrest. 'And a good job too,' said Julia, 'otherwisethey'd have had my name out of him when he confessed.'Since then there had been various others. Life as she saw itwas quite simple. You wanted a good time; 'they', meaningthe Party, wanted to stop you having it; you broke the rulesas best you could. She seemed to think it just as natural that'they' should want to rob you of your pleasures as that youshould want to avoid being caught. She hated the Party, andsaid so in the crudest words, but she made no general criti-cism of it. Except where it touched upon her own life shehad no interest in Party doctrine. He noticed that she neverused Newspeak words except the ones that had passed intoeveryday use. She had never heard of the Brotherhood, andrefused to believe in its existence. Any kind of organizedrevolt against the Party, which was bound to be a failure,struck her as stupid. The clever thing was to break the rulesand stay alive all the same. He wondered vaguely how many

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 165

others like her there might be in the younger generationpeople who had grown up in the world of the Revolution,knowing nothing else, accepting the Party as somethingunalterable, like the sky, not rebelling against its authoritybut simply evading it, as a rabbit dodges a dog.

They did not discuss the possibility of getting married.It was too remote to be worth thinking about. No imagin-able committee would ever sanction such a marriage evenif Katharine, Winston's wife, could somehow have been gotrid of. It was hopeless even as a daydream.

'What was she like, your wife?' said Julia.

'She was—do you know the Newspeak word GOOD-THINKFUL? Meaning naturally orthodox, incapable ofthinking a bad thought?'

'No, I didn't know the word, but I know the kind of per-son, right enough.'

He began telling her the story of his married life, but cu-riously enough she appeared to know the essential parts ofit already. She described to him, almost as though she hadseen or felt it, the stiffening of Katharine's body as soonas he touched her, the way in which she still seemed to bepushing him from her with all her strength, even when herarms were clasped tightly round him. With Julia he felt nodifficulty in talking about such things: Katharine, in anycase, had long ceased to be a painful memory and becamemerely a distasteful one.

'I could have stood it if it hadn't been for one thing,' hesaid. He told her about the frigid little ceremony that Kath-arine had forced him to go through on the same night every

1984

week. 'She hated it, but nothing would make her stop doingit. She used to call it—but you'll never guess.'

'Our duty to the Party' said Julia promptly.

'How did you know that?'

'I've been at school too, dear. Sex talks once a month forthe over-sixteens. And in the Youth Movement. They rub itinto you for years. I dare say it works in a lot of cases. But ofcourse you can never tell; people are such hypocrites.'

She began to enlarge upon the subject. With Julia, every-thing came back to her own sexuality. As soon as this wastouched upon in any way she was capable of great acuteness.Unlike Winston, she had grasped the inner meaning of theParty's sexual puritanism. It was not merely that the sexinstinct created a world of its own which was outside theParty's control and which therefore had to be destroyed ifpossible. What was more important was that sexual priva-tion induced hysteria, which was desirable because it couldbe transformed into war-fever and leader-worship. The wayshe put it was:

'When you make love you're using up energy; and after-wards you feel happy and don't give a damn for anything.They can't bear you to feel like that. They want you to bebursting with energy all the time. All this marching up anddown and cheering and waving flags is simply sex gone sour.If you're happy inside yourself, why should you get excitedabout Big Brother and the Three-Year Plans and the TwoMinutes Hate and all the rest of their bloody rot?'

That was very true, he thought. There was a direct inti-mate connexion between chastity and political orthodoxy.

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 167

For how could the fear, the hatred, and the lunatic credulitywhich the Party needed in its members be kept at the rightpitch, except by bottling down some powerful instinct andusing it as a driving force? The sex impulse was dangerous tothe Party, and the Party had turned it to account. They hadplayed a similar trick with the instinct of parenthood. Thefamily could not actually be abolished, and, indeed, peoplewere encouraged to be fond of their children, in almost theold-fashioned way. The children, on the other hand, weresystematically turned against their parents and taught tospy on them and report their deviations. The family hadbecome in effect an extension of the Thought Police. It wasa device by means of which everyone could be surroundednight and day by informers who knew him intimately.

Abruptly his mind went back to Katharine. Katharinewould unquestionably have denounced him to the ThoughtPolice if she had not happened to be too stupid to detect theunorthodoxy of his opinions. But what really recalled herto him at this moment was the stifling heat of the afternoon,which had brought the sweat out on his forehead. He begantelling Julia of something that had happened, or rather hadfailed to happen, on another sweltering summer afternoon,eleven years ago.

It was three or four months after they were married. Theyhad lost their way on a community hike somewhere in Kent.They had only lagged behind the others for a couple of min-utes, but they took a wrong turning, and presently foundthemselves pulled up short by the edge of an old chalkquarry. It was a sheer drop of ten or twenty metres, with

1984

boulders at the bottom. There was nobody of whom theycould ask the way As soon as she realized that they werelost Katharine became very uneasy To be away from thenoisy mob of hikers even for a moment gave her a feeling ofwrong-doing. She wanted to hurry back by the way they hadcome and start searching in the other direction. But at thismoment Winston noticed some tufts of loosestrife growingin the cracks of the cliff beneath them. One tuft was of twocolours, magenta and brick-red, apparently growing on thesame root. He had never seen anything of the kind before,and he called to Katharine to come and look at it.

'Look, Katharine! Look at those flowers. That clumpdown near the bottom. Do you see they're two different co-lours?'

She had already turned to go, but she did rather fretfullycome back for a moment. She even leaned out over the cliffface to see where he was pointing. He was standing a littlebehind her, and he put his hand on her waist to steady her.At this moment it suddenly occurred to him how completelyalone they were. There was not a human creature anywhere,not a leaf stirring, not even a bird awake. In a place likethis the danger that there would be a hidden microphonewas very small, and even if there was a microphone it wouldonly pick up sounds. It was the hottest sleepiest hour of theafternoon. The sun blazed down upon them, the sweat tick-led his face. And the thought struck him...

'Why didn't you give her a good shove?' said Julia. 'Iwould have.'

'Yes, dear, you would have. I would, if I'd been the same

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 169

person then as I am now. Or perhaps I would—I'm not cer-tain.'

'Are you sorry you didn't?'

'Yes. On the whole I'm sorry I didn't.'

They were sitting side by side on the dusty floor. Hepulled her closer against him. Her head rested on his shoul-der, the pleasant smell of her hair conquering the pigeondung. She was very young, he thought, she still expectedsomething from life, she did not understand that to push aninconvenient person over a cliff solves nothing.

'Actually it would have made no difference,' he said.

"Then why are you sorry you didn't do it?'

'Only because I prefer a positive to a negative. In thisgame that we're playing, we can't win. Some kinds of failureare better than other kinds, that's all.'

He felt her shoulders give a wriggle of dissent. She al-ways contradicted him when he said anything of this kind.She would not accept it as a law of nature that the individ-ual is always defeated. In a way she realized that she herselfwas doomed, that sooner or later the Thought Police wouldcatch her and kill her, but with another part of her mindshe believed that it was somehow possible to construct a se-cret world in which you could live as you chose. All youneeded was luck and cunning and boldness. She did not un-derstand that there was no such thing as happiness, that theonly victory lay in the far future, long after you were dead,that from the moment of declaring war on the Party it wasbetter to think of yourself as a corpse.

'We are the dead,' he said.

1984

'We're not dead yet,' said Julia prosaically.

'Not physically Six months, a year—five years, conceiv-ably. I am afraid of death. You are young, so presumablyyou're more afraid of it than I am. Obviously we shall put itoff as long as we can. But it makes very little difference. Solong as human beings stay human, death and life are thesame thing.'

'Oh, rubbish! Which would you sooner sleep with, me ora skeleton? Don't you enjoy being alive? Don't you like feel-ing: This is me, this is my hand, this is my leg, I'm real, I'msolid, I'm alive! Don't you like THIS?'

She twisted herself round and pressed her bosom againsthim. He could feel her breasts, ripe yet firm, through heroveralls. Her body seemed to be pouring some of its youthand vigour into his.

'Yes, I like that,' he said.

"Then stop talking about dying. And now listen, dear,we've got to fix up about the next time we meet. We may aswell go back to the place in the wood. We've given it a goodlong rest. But you must get there by a different way this time.I've got it all planned out. You take the train—but look, I'lldraw it out for you.'

And in her practical way she scraped together a smallsquare of dust, and with a twig from a pigeon's nest begandrawing a map on the floor.

Chapter 4

Winston looked round the shabby little room above MrCharrington's shop. Beside the window the enormousbed was made up, with ragged blankets and a coverless bol-ster. The old-fashioned clock with the twelve-hour face wasticking away on the mantelpiece. In the corner, on the gate-leg table, the glass paperweight which he had bought on hislast visit gleamed softly out of the half-darkness.

In the fender was a battered tin oilstove, a saucepan, andtwo cups, provided by Mr Charrington. Winston lit theburner and set a pan of water to boil. He had brought anenvelope full of Victory Coffee and some saccharine tablets.The clock's hands said seventeen-twenty: it was nineteen-twenty really. She was coming at nineteen-thirty

Folly, folly, his heart kept saying: conscious, gratuitous,suicidal folly. Of all the crimes that a Party member couldcommit, this one was the least possible to conceal. Actu-ally the idea had first floated into his head in the form of avision, of the glass paperweight mirrored by the surface ofthe gateleg table. As he had foreseen, Mr Charrington hadmade no difficulty about letting the room. He was obviouslyglad of the few dollars that it would bring him. Nor did heseem shocked or become offensively knowing when it wasmade clear that Winston wanted the room for the purposeof a love-affair. Instead he looked into the middle distance

1984

and spoke in generalities, with so delicate an air as to givethe impression that he had become partly invisible. Privacy,he said, was a very valuable thing. Everyone wanted a placewhere they could be alone occasionally. And when they hadsuch a place, it was only common courtesy in anyone elsewho knew of it to keep his knowledge to himself. He even,seeming almost to fade out of existence as he did so, add-ed that there were two entries to the house, one of themthrough the back yard, which gave on an alley.

Under the window somebody was singing. Winstonpeeped out, secure in the protection of the muslin curtain.The June sun was still high in the sky, and in the sun-filledcourt below, a monstrous woman, solid as a Norman pil-lar, with brawny red forearms and a sacking apron strappedabout her middle, was stumping to and fro between a wash-tub and a clothes line, pegging out a series of square whitethings which Winston recognized as babies' diapers. When-ever her mouth was not corked with clothes pegs she wassinging in a powerful contralto:

It was only an 'opeless fancy.

It passed like an Ipril dye,

But a look an a word an the dreams they stirred!

They 'ave

stolen my 'eart awye!

The tune had been haunting London for weeks past. Itwas one of countless similar songs published for the ben-efit of the proles by a sub-section of the Music Department.

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 173

The words of these songs were composed without any hu-man intervention whatever on an instrument known as aversificator. But the woman sang so tunefully as to turn thedreadful rubbish into an almost pleasant sound. He couldhear the woman singing and the scrape of her shoes on theflagstones, and the cries of the children in the street, andsomewhere in the far distance a faint roar of traffic, and yetthe room seemed curiously silent, thanks to the absence ofa telescreen.

Folly, folly, folly! he thought again. It was inconceiv-able that they could frequent this place for more than a fewweeks without being caught. But the temptation of having ahiding-place that was truly their own, indoors and near athand, had been too much for both of them. For some timeafter their visit to the church belfry it had been impossibleto arrange meetings. Working hours had been drasticallyincreased in anticipation of Hate Week. It was more thana month distant, but the enormous, complex preparationsthat it entailed were throwing extra work on to everybody.Finally both of them managed to secure a free afternoon onthe same day. They had agreed to go back to the clearingin the wood. On the evening beforehand they met brieflyin the street. As usual, Winston hardly looked at Julia asthey drifted towards one another in the crowd, but fromthe short glance he gave her it seemed to him that she waspaler than usual.

'It's all off,' she murmured as soon as she judged it safe tospeak. 'Tomorrow, I mean.'

'What?'

1984

'Tomorrow afternoon. I can't come.'

'Why not?'

'Oh, the usual reason. It's started early this time.'

For a moment he was violently angry. During the monththat he had known her the nature of his desire for her hadchanged. At the beginning there had been little true sensu-ality in it. Their first love-making had been simply an actof the will. But after the second time it was different. Thesmell of her hair, the taste of her mouth, the feeling of herskin seemed to have got inside him, or into the air all roundhim. She had become a physical necessity, something thathe not only wanted but felt that he had a right to. When shesaid that she could not come, he had the feeling that she wascheating him. But just at this moment the crowd pressedthem together and their hands accidentally met. She gavethe tips of his fingers a quick squeeze that seemed to in-vite not desire but affection. It struck him that when onelived with a woman this particular disappointment must bea normal, recurring event; and a deep tenderness, such ashe had not felt for her before, suddenly took hold of him. Hewished that they were a married couple of ten years' stand-ing. He wished that he were walking through the streetswith her just as they were doing now but openly and with-out fear, talking of trivialities and buying odds and endsfor the household. He wished above all that they had someplace where they could be alone together without feelingthe obligation to make love every time they met. It was notactually at that moment, but at some time on the followingday, that the idea of renting Mr Charrington's room had oc-

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 175

curred to him. When he suggested it to Julia she had agreedwith unexpected readiness. Both of them knew that it waslunacy. It was as though they were intentionally steppingnearer to their graves. As he sat waiting on the edge of thebed he thought again of the cellars of the Ministry of Love.It was curious how that predestined horror moved in andout of one's consciousness. There it lay, fixed in future times,preceding death as surely as 99 precedes 100. One could notavoid it, but one could perhaps postpone it: and yet instead,every now and again, by a conscious, wilful act, one choseto shorten the interval before it happened.

At this moment there was a quick step on the stairs. Juliaburst into the room. She was carrying a tool-bag of coarsebrown canvas, such as he had sometimes seen her carryingto and fro at the Ministry. He started forward to take her inhis arms, but she disengaged herself rather hurriedly, partlybecause she was still holding the tool-bag.

'Half a second,' she said. 'Just let me show you what I'vebrought. Did you bring some of that filthy Victory Coffee?I thought you would. You can chuck it away again, becausewe shan't be needing it. Look here.'

She fell on her knees, threw open the bag, and tumbledout some spanners and a screwdriver that filled the top partof it. Underneath were a number of neat paper packets. Thefirst packet that she passed to Winston had a strange andyet vaguely familiar feeling. It was filled with some kind ofheavy, sand-like stuff which yielded wherever you touchedit.

'It isn't sugar?' he said.

176 1984

'Real sugar. Not saccharine, sugar. And here's a loaf ofbread—proper white bread, not our bloody stuff—and a lit-tle pot of jam. And here's a tin of milk—but look! This is theone I'm really proud of. I had to wrap a bit of sacking roundit, because '

But she did not need to tell him why she had wrapped itup. The smell was already filling the room, a rich hot smellwhich seemed like an emanation from his early childhood,but which one did occasionally meet with even now, blow-ing down a passage-way before a door slammed, or diffusingitself mysteriously in a crowded street, sniffed for an instantand then lost again.

'It's coffee,' he murmured, 'real coffee.'

'It's Inner Party coffee. There's a whole kilo here,' shesaid.

'How did you manage to get hold of all these things?'

'It's all Inner Party stuff. There's nothing those swinedon't have, nothing. But of course waiters and servants andpeople pinch things, and—look, I got a little packet of teaas well.'

Winston had squatted down beside her. He tore open acorner of the packet.

'It's real tea. Not blackberry leaves.'

"There's been a lot of tea about lately. They've captured In-dia, or something,' she said vaguely. 'But listen, dear. I wantyou to turn your back on me for three minutes. Go and siton the other side of the bed. Don't go too near the window.And don't turn round till I tell you.'

Winston gazed abstractedly through the muslin curtain.

Down in the yard the red-armed woman was still marchingto and fro between the washtub and the line. She took twomore pegs out of her mouth and sang with deep feeling:

They sye that time 'eals all things,

They sye you can always forget;

But the smiles an the tears acrorss the years

They twist my

'eart-strings yet!

She knew the whole drivelling song by heart, it seemed.Her voice floated upward with the sweet summer air, verytuneful, charged with a sort of happy melancholy. One hadthe feeling that she would have been perfectly content, if theJune evening had been endless and the supply of clothes in-exhaustible, to remain there for a thousand years, peggingout diapers and singing rubbish. It struck him as a curiousfact that he had never heard a member of the Party singingalone and spontaneously. It would even have seemed slightlyunorthodox, a dangerous eccentricity, like talking to one-self. Perhaps it was only when people were somewhere nearthe starvation level that they had anything to sing about.

'You can turn round now,' said Julia.

He turned round, and for a second almost failed to rec-ognize her. What he had actually expected was to see hernaked. But she was not naked. The transformation that hadhappened was much more surprising than that. She hadpainted her face.

She must have slipped into some shop in the proletarian

178 1984

quarters and bought herself a complete set of make-up ma-terials. Her lips were deeply reddened, her cheeks rouged,her nose powdered; there was even a touch of somethingunder the eyes to make them brighter. It was not very skil-fully done, but Winston's standards in such matters werenot high. He had never before seen or imagined a woman ofthe Party with cosmetics on her face. The improvement inher appearance was startling. With just a few dabs of colourin the right places she had become not only very much pret-tier, but, above all, far more feminine. Her short hair andboyish overalls merely added to the effect. As he took her inhis arms a wave of synthetic violets flooded his nostrils. Heremembered the half-darkness of a basement kitchen, and awoman's cavernous mouth. It was the very same scent thatshe had used; but at the moment it did not seem to matter.

'Scent too!' he said.

'Yes, dear, scent too. And do you know what I'm going todo next? I'm going to get hold of a real woman's frock fromsomewhere and wear it instead of these bloody trousers. I'llwear silk stockings and high-heeled shoes! In this room I'mgoing to be a woman, not a Party comrade.'

They flung their clothes off and climbed into the hugemahogany bed. It was the first time that he had strippedhimself naked in her presence. Until now he had been toomuch ashamed of his pale and meagre body, with the vari-cose veins standing out on his calves and the discolouredpatch over his ankle. There were no sheets, but the blanketthey lay on was threadbare and smooth, and the size andspringiness of the bed astonished both of them. 'It's sure

to be full of bugs, but who cares?' said Julia. One never sawa double bed nowadays, except in the homes of the proles.Winston had occasionally slept in one in his boyhood: Juliahad never been in one before, so far as she could remember.

Presently they fell asleep for a little while. When Win-ston woke up the hands of the clock had crept round tonearly nine. He did not stir, because Julia was sleeping withher head in the crook of his arm. Most of her make-up hadtransferred itself to his own face or the bolster, but a lightstain of rouge still brought out the beauty of her cheekbone.A yellow ray from the sinking sun fell across the foot of thebed and lighted up the fireplace, where the water in the panwas boiling fast. Down in the yard the woman had stoppedsinging, but the faint shouts of children floated in from thestreet. He wondered vaguely whether in the abolished pastit had been a normal experience to lie in bed like this, inthe cool of a summer evening, a man and a woman with noclothes on, making love when they chose, talking of whatthey chose, not feeling any compulsion to get up, simply ly-ing there and listening to peaceful sounds outside. Surelythere could never have been a time when that seemed ordi-nary? Julia woke up, rubbed her eyes, and raised herself onher elbow to look at the oilstove.

'Half that water's boiled away' she said. 'I'll get up andmake some coffee in another moment. We've got an hour.What time do they cut the lights off at your flats?'

'Twenty-three thirty'

'It's twenty-three at the hostel. But you have to get in ear-lier than that, because—Hi! Get out, you filthy brute!'

She suddenly twisted herself over in the bed, seized ashoe from the floor, and sent it hurtling into the corner witha boyish jerk of her arm, exactly as he had seen her fling thedictionary at Goldstein, that morning during the Two Min-utes Hate.

'What was it?' he said in surprise.

'A rat. I saw him stick his beastly nose out of the wain-scoting. There's a hole down there. I gave him a good fright,anyway'

'Rats!' murmured Winston. 'In this room!'

'They're all over the place,' said Julia indifferently as shelay down again. 'We've even got them in the kitchen at thehostel. Some parts of London are swarming with them. Didyou know they attack children? Yes, they do. In some ofthese streets a woman daren't leave a baby alone for twominutes. It's the great huge brown ones that do it. And thenasty thing is that the brutes always '

'DON'T GO ON!' said Winston, with his eyes tightlyshut.

'Dearest! You've gone quite pale. What's the matter? Dothey make you feel sick?'

'Of all horrors in the world—a rat!'

She pressed herself against him and wound her limbsround him, as though to reassure him with the warmthof her body. He did not reopen his eyes immediately. Forseveral moments he had had the feeling of being back in anightmare which had recurred from time to time through-out his life. It was always very much the same. He wasstanding in front of a wall of darkness, and on the other

side of it there was something unendurable, something toodreadful to be faced. In the dream his deepest feeling wasalways one of self-deception, because he did in fact knowwhat was behind the wall of darkness. With a deadly effort,like wrenching a piece out of his own brain, he could evenhave dragged the thing into the open. He always woke upwithout discovering what it was: but somehow it was con-nected with what Julia had been saying when he cut hershort.

'I'm sorry' he said, 'it's nothing. I don't like rats, that'sall'

'Don't worry, dear, we're not going to have the filthybrutes in here. I'll stuff the hole with a bit of sacking beforewe go. And next time we come here I'll bring some plasterand bung it up properly'

Already the black instant of panic was half-forgotten.Feeling slightly ashamed of himself, he sat up against thebedhead. Julia got out of bed, pulled on her overalls, andmade the coffee. The smell that rose from the saucepan wasso powerful and exciting that they shut the window lestanybody outside should notice it and become inquisitive.What was even better than the taste of the coffee was thesilky texture given to it by the sugar, a thing Winston hadalmost forgotten after years of saccharine. With one handin her pocket and a piece of bread and jam in the other, Ju-lia wandered about the room, glancing indifferently at thebookcase, pointing out the best way of repairing the gate-leg table, plumping herself down in the ragged arm-chair tosee if it was comfortable, and examining the absurd twelve-

1984

hour clock with a sort of tolerant amusement. She broughtthe glass paperweight over to the bed to have a look at it in abetter light. He took it out of her hand, fascinated, as always,by the soft, rainwatery appearance of the glass.

'What is it, do you think?' said Julia.

'I don't think it's anything—I mean, I don't think it wasever put to any use. That's what I like about it. It's a littlechunk of history that they've forgotten to alter. It's a mes-sage from a hundred years ago, if one knew how to read it.'

'And that picture over there'—she nodded at the engrav-ing on the opposite wall—'would that be a hundred yearsold?'

'More. Two hundred, I dare say. One can't tell. It's impos-sible to discover the age of anything nowadays.'

She went over to look at it. 'Here's where that brute stuckhis nose out,' she said, kicking the wainscoting immediate-ly below the picture. 'What is this place? I've seen it beforesomewhere.'

'It's a church, or at least it used to be. St Clement Danesits name was.' The fragment of rhyme that Mr Charringtonhad taught him came back into his head, and he addedhalf-nostalgically: 'Oranges and lemons, say the bells of StClement's!'

To his astonishment she capped the line:

'You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin's,When will you pay me? say the bells of Old Bailey '

'I can't remember how it goes on after that. But anyway

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 183

I remember it ends up, 'Here comes a candle to light you tobed, here comes a chopper to chop off your head!"

It was like the two halves of a countersign. But theremust be another line after 'the bells of Old Bailey'. Perhapsit could be dug out of Mr Charrington's memory, if he weresuitably prompted.

'Who taught you that?' he said.

'My grandfather. He used to say it to me when I was a lit-tle girl. He was vaporized when I was eight—at any rate, hedisappeared. I wonder what a lemon was,' she added incon-sequently 'I've seen oranges. They're a kind of round yellowfruit with a thick skin.'

T can remember lemons,' said Winston. "They were quitecommon in the fifties. They were so sour that it set yourteeth on edge even to smell them.'

T bet that picture's got bugs behind it,' said Julia. 'I'lltake it down and give it a good clean some day. I supposeit's almost time we were leaving. I must start washing thispaint off. What a bore! I'll get the lipstick off your face af-terwards.'

Winston did not get up for a few minutes more. Theroom was darkening. He turned over towards the light andlay gazing into the glass paperweight. The inexhaustiblyinteresting thing was not the fragment of coral but the in-terior of the glass itself. There was such a depth of it, andyet it was almost as transparent as air. It was as though thesurface of the glass had been the arch of the sky, enclosinga tiny world with its atmosphere complete. He had the feel-ing that he could get inside it, and that in fact he was inside

it, along with the mahogany bed and the gateleg table, andthe clock and the steel engraving and the paperweight itself.The paperweight was the room he was in, and the coral wasJulia's life and his own, fixed in a sort of eternity at the heartof the crystal.

Syme had vanished. A morning came, and he was miss-ing from work: a few thoughtless people commented onhis absence. On the next day nobody mentioned him. Onthe third day Winston went into the vestibule of the Re-cords Department to look at the notice-board. One of thenotices carried a printed list of the members of the ChessCommittee, of whom Syme had been one. It looked almostexactly as it had looked before—nothing had been crossedout—but it was one name shorter. It was enough. Syme hadceased to exist: he had never existed.

The weather was baking hot. In the labyrinthine Ministrythe windowless, air-conditioned rooms kept their normaltemperature, but outside the pavements scorched one's feetand the stench of the Tubes at the rush hours was a hor-ror. The preparations for Hate Week were in full swing, andthe staffs of all the Ministries were working overtime. Pro-cessions, meetings, military parades, lectures, waxworks,displays, film shows, telescreen programmes all had to beorganized; stands had to be erected, effigies built, sloganscoined, songs written, rumours circulated, photographsfaked. Julia's unit in the Fiction Department had been tak-en off the production of novels and was rushing out a seriesof atrocity pamphlets. Winston, in addition to his regularwork, spent long periods every day in going through back

1984

files of 'The Times' and altering and embellishing newsitems which were to be quoted in speeches. Late at night,when crowds of rowdy proles roamed the streets, the townhad a curiously febrile air. The rocket bombs crashed of-tener than ever, and sometimes in the far distance therewere enormous explosions which no one could explain andabout which there were wild rumours.

The new tune which was to be the theme-song of HateWeek (the Hate Song, it was called) had already been com-posed and was being endlessly plugged on the telescreens.It had a savage, barking rhythm which could not exactly becalled music, but resembled the beating of a drum. Roaredout by hundreds of voices to the tramp of marching feet, itwas terrifying. The proles had taken a fancy to it, and in themidnight streets it competed with the still-popular 'It wasonly a hopeless fancy'. The Parsons children played it at allhours of the night and day, unbearably, on a comb and apiece of toilet paper. Winston's evenings were fuller thanever. Squads of volunteers, organized by Parsons, were pre-paring the street for Hate Week, stitching banners, paintingposters, erecting flagstaff's on the roofs, and perilously sling-ing wires across the street for the reception of streamers.Parsons boasted that Victory Mansions alone would displayfour hundred metres of bunting. He was in his native ele-ment and as happy as a lark. The heat and the manual workhad even given him a pretext for reverting to shorts andan open shirt in the evenings. He was everywhere at once,pushing, pulling, sawing, hammering, improvising, jolly-ing everyone along with comradely exhortations and giving

out from every fold of his body what seemed an inexhaust-ible supply of acrid-smelling sweat.

A new poster had suddenly appeared all over London. Ithad no caption, and represented simply the monstrous fig-ure of a Eurasian soldier, three or four metres high, stridingforward with expressionless Mongolian face and enor-mous boots, a submachine gun pointed from his hip. Fromwhatever angle you looked at the poster, the muzzle of thegun, magnified by the foreshortening, seemed to be point-ed straight at you. The thing had been plastered on everyblank space on every wall, even outnumbering the por-traits of Big Brother. The proles, normally apathetic aboutthe war, were being lashed into one of their periodical fren-zies of patriotism. As though to harmonize with the generalmood, the rocket bombs had been killing larger numbersof people than usual. One fell on a crowded film theatre inStepney, burying several hundred victims among the ruins.The whole population of the neighbourhood turned out fora long, trailing funeral which went on for hours and was ineffect an indignation meeting. Another bomb fell on a pieceof waste ground which was used as a playground and sever-al dozen children were blown to pieces. There were furtherangry demonstrations, Goldstein was burned in effigy, hun-dreds of copies of the poster of the Eurasian soldier weretorn down and added to the flames, and a number of shopswere looted in the turmoil; then a rumour flew round thatspies were directing the rocket bombs by means of wirelesswaves, and an old couple who were suspected of being offoreign extraction had their house set on fire and perished

of suffocation.

In the room over Mr Charrington's shop, when they couldget there, Julia and Winston lay side by side on a strippedbed under the open window, naked for the sake of coolness.The rat had never come back, but the bugs had multipliedhideously in the heat. It did not seem to matter. Dirty orclean, the room was paradise. As soon as they arrived theywould sprinkle everything with pepper bought on the blackmarket, tear off their clothes, and make love with sweatingbodies, then fall asleep and wake to find that the bugs hadrallied and were massing for the counter-attack.

Four, five, six—seven times they met during the monthof June. Winston had dropped his habit of drinking gin atall hours. He seemed to have lost the need for it. He hadgrown fatter, his varicose ulcer had subsided, leaving onlya brown stain on the skin above his ankle, his fits of cough-ing in the early morning had stopped. The process of lifehad ceased to be intolerable, he had no longer any impulseto make faces at the telescreen or shout curses at the top ofhis voice. Now that they had a secure hiding-place, almost ahome, it did not even seem a hardship that they could onlymeet infrequently and for a couple of hours at a time. Whatmattered was that the room over the junk-shop should exist.To know that it was there, inviolate, was almost the same asbeing in it. The room was a world, a pocket of the past whereextinct animals could walk. Mr Charrington, thought Win-ston, was another extinct animal. He usually stopped to talkwith Mr Charrington for a few minutes on his way upstairs.The old man seemed seldom or never to go out of doors,

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 189

and on the other hand to have almost no customers. Heled a ghostlike existence between the tiny, dark shop, andan even tinier back kitchen where he prepared his mealsand which contained, among other things, an unbelievablyancient gramophone with an enormous horn. He seemedglad of the opportunity to talk. Wandering about amonghis worthless stock, with his long nose and thick spectaclesand his bowed shoulders in the velvet jacket, he had alwaysvaguely the air of being a collector rather than a tradesman.With a sort of faded enthusiasm he would finger this scrapof rubbish or that—a china bottle-stopper, the painted lid ofa broken snuffbox, a pinchbeck locket containing a strandof some long-dead baby's hair—never asking that Winstonshould buy it, merely that he should admire it. To talk tohim was like listening to the tinkling of a worn-out musical-box. He had dragged out from the corners of his memorysome more fragments of forgotten rhymes. There was oneabout four and twenty blackbirds, and another about a cowwith a crumpled horn, and another about the death of poorCock Robin. 'It just occurred to me you might be interested,'he would say with a deprecating little laugh whenever heproduced a new fragment. But he could never recall morethan a few lines of any one rhyme.

Both of them knew—in a way, it was never out of theirminds that what was now happening could not last long.There were times when the fact of impending death seemedas palpable as the bed they lay on, and they would cling to-gether with a sort of despairing sensuality, like a damnedsoul grasping at his last morsel of pleasure when the clock

is within five minutes of striking. But there were also timeswhen they had the illusion not only of safety but of per-manence. So long as they were actually in this room, theyboth felt, no harm could come to them. Getting there wasdifficult and dangerous, but the room itself was sanctuary.It was as when Winston had gazed into the heart of the pa-perweight, with the feeling that it would be possible to getinside that glassy world, and that once inside it time couldbe arrested. Often they gave themselves up to daydreams ofescape. Their luck would hold indefinitely, and they wouldcarry on their intrigue, just like this, for the remainder oftheir natural lives. Or Katharine would die, and by subtlemanoeuvrings Winston and Julia would succeed in get-ting married. Or they would commit suicide together. Orthey would disappear, alter themselves out of recognition,learn to speak with proletarian accents, get jobs in a factoryand live out their lives undetected in a back-street. It wasall nonsense, as they both knew. In reality there was no es-cape. Even the one plan that was practicable, suicide, theyhad no intention of carrying out. To hang on from day today and from week to week, spinning out a present that hadno future, seemed an unconquerable instinct, just as one'slungs will always draw the next breath so long as there isair available.

Sometimes, too, they talked of engaging in active rebel-lion against the Party, but with no notion of how to takethe first step. Even if the fabulous Brotherhood was a real-ity, there still remained the difficulty of finding one's wayinto it. He told her of the strange intimacy that existed, or

seemed to exist, between himself and O'Brien, and of theimpulse he sometimes felt, simply to walk into O'Brien'spresence, announce that he was the enemy of the Party, anddemand his help. Curiously enough, this did not strike heras an impossibly rash thing to do. She was used to judg-ing people by their faces, and it seemed natural to her thatWinston should believe O'Brien to be trustworthy on thestrength of a single flash of the eyes. Moreover she took itfor granted that everyone, or nearly everyone, secretly hatedthe Party and would break the rules if he thought it safe todo so. But she refused to believe that widespread, organizedopposition existed or could exist. The tales about Goldsteinand his underground army, she said, were simply a lot ofrubbish which the Party had invented for its own purposesand which you had to pretend to believe in. Times beyondnumber, at Party rallies and spontaneous demonstrations,she had shouted at the top of her voice for the execution ofpeople whose names she had never heard and in whose sup-posed crimes she had not the faintest belief. When publictrials were happening she had taken her place in the detach-ments from the Youth League who surrounded the courtsfrom morning to night, chanting at intervals 'Death to thetraitors!' During the Two Minutes Hate she always excelledall others in shouting insults at Goldstein. Yet she had onlythe dimmest idea of who Goldstein was and what doctrineshe was supposed to represent. She had grown up since theRevolution and was too young to remember the ideologicalbattles of the fifties and sixties. Such a thing as an indepen-dent political movement was outside her imagination: and

1984

in any case the Party was invincible. It would always ex-ist, and it would always be the same. You could only rebelagainst it by secret disobedience or, at most, by isolated actsof violence such as killing somebody or blowing somethingup.

In some ways she was far more acute than Winston, andfar less susceptible to Party propaganda. Once when hehappened in some connexion to mention the war againstEurasia, she startled him by saying casually that in her opin-ion the war was not happening. The rocket bombs which felldaily on London were probably fired by the Governmentof Oceania itself, 'just to keep people frightened'. This wasan idea that had literally never occurred to him. She alsostirred a sort of envy in him by telling him that during theTwo Minutes Hate her great difficulty was to avoid burstingout laughing. But she only questioned the teachings of theParty when they in some way touched upon her own life.Often she was ready to accept the official mythology, simplybecause the difference between truth and falsehood did notseem important to her. She believed, for instance, havinglearnt it at school, that the Party had invented aeroplanes.(In his own schooldays, Winston remembered, in the latefifties, it was only the helicopter that the Party claimed tohave invented; a dozen years later, when Julia was at school,it was already claiming the aeroplane; one generation more,and it would be claiming the steam engine.) And when hetold her that aeroplanes had been in existence before he wasborn and long before the Revolution, the fact struck her astotally uninteresting. After all, what did it matter who had

invented aeroplanes? It was rather more of a shock to himwhen he discovered from some chance remark that she didnot remember that Oceania, four years ago, had been at warwith Eastasia and at peace with Eurasia. It was true that sheregarded the whole war as a sham: but apparently she hadnot even noticed that the name of the enemy had changed.'I thought we'd always been at war with Eurasia,' she saidvaguely. It frightened him a little. The invention of aero-planes dated from long before her birth, but the switchoverin the war had happened only four years ago, well after shewas grown up. He argued with her about it for perhaps aquarter of an hour. In the end he succeeded in forcing hermemory back until she did dimly recall that at one timeEastasia and not Eurasia had been the enemy. But the issuestill struck her as unimportant. 'Who cares?' she said im-patiently. 'It's always one bloody war after another, and oneknows the news is all lies anyway'

Sometimes he talked to her of the Records Departmentand the impudent forgeries that he committed there. Suchthings did not appear to horrify her. She did not feel theabyss opening beneath her feet at the thought of lies becom-ing truths. He told her the story of Jones, Aaronson, andRutherford and the momentous slip of paper which he hadonce held between his fingers. It did not make much im-pression on her. At first, indeed, she failed to grasp the pointof the story.

'Were they friends of yours?' she said.

'No, I never knew them. They were Inner Party members.Besides, they were far older men than I was. They belonged

1984

to the old days, before the Revolution. I barely knew themby sight.'

"Then what was there to worry about? People are beingkilled off all the time, aren't they?'

He tried to make her understand. "This was an excep-tional case. It wasn't just a question of somebody beingkilled. Do you realize that the past, starting from yester-day, has been actually abolished? If it survives anywhere,it's in a few solid objects with no words attached to them,like that lump of glass there. Already we know almost lit-erally nothing about the Revolution and the years beforethe Revolution. Every record has been destroyed or falsi-fied, every book has been rewritten, every picture has beenrepainted, every statue and street and building has beenrenamed, every date has been altered. And that process iscontinuing day by day and minute by minute. History hasstopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in whichthe Party is always right. I know, of course, that the past isfalsified, but it would never be possible for me to prove it,even when I did the falsification myself. After the thing isdone, no evidence ever remains. The only evidence is insidemy own mind, and I don't know with any certainty that anyother human being shares my memories. Just in that oneinstance, in my whole life, I did possess actual concrete evi-dence after the event—years after it.'

And what good was that?'

'It was no good, because I threw it away a few minutes lat-er. But if the same thing happened today, I should keep it.'

'Well, I wouldn't!' said Julia. 'I'm quite ready to take

Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com

risks, but only for something worth while, not for bits ofold newspaper. What could you have done with it even ifyou had kept it?'

'Not much, perhaps. But it was evidence. It might haveplanted a few doubts here and there, supposing that I'ddared to show it to anybody. I don't imagine that we canalter anything in our own lifetime. But one can imagine lit-tle knots of resistance springing up here and there—smallgroups of people banding themselves together, and gradu-ally growing, and even leaving a few records behind, so thatthe next generations can carry on where we leave off.'

'I'm not interested in the next generation, dear. I'm inter-ested in US.'

'You're only a rebel from the waist downwards,' he toldher.

She thought this brilliantly witty and flung her armsround him in delight.

In the ramifications of party doctrine she had not thefaintest interest. Whenever he began to talk of the princi-ples of Ingsoc, doublethink, the mutability of the past, andthe denial of objective reality, and to use Newspeak words,she became bored and confused and said that she never paidany attention to that kind of thing. One knew that it was allrubbish, so why let oneself be worried by it? She knew whento cheer and when to boo, and that was all one needed. If hepersisted in talking of such subjects, she had a disconcertinghabit of falling asleep. She was one of those people who cango to sleep at any hour and in any position. Talking to her,he realized how easy it was to present an appearance of or-

196 1984

thodoxy while having no grasp whatever of what orthodoxymeant. In a way, the world-view of the Party imposed itselfmost successfully on people incapable of understanding it.They could be made to accept the most flagrant violationsof reality, because they never fully grasped the enormityof what was demanded of them, and were not sufficientlyinterested in public events to notice what was happening.By lack of understanding they remained sane. They simplyswallowed everything, and what they swallowed did themno harm, because it left no residue behind, just as a grain ofcorn will pass undigested through the body of a bird.

Chapter 6

It had happened at last. The expected message had come.All his life, it seemed to him, he had been waiting for thisto happen.

He was walking down the long corridor at the Minis-try and he was almost at the spot where Julia had slippedthe note into his hand when he became aware that some-one larger than himself was walking just behind him. Theperson, whoever it was, gave a small cough, evidently as aprelude to speaking. Winston stopped abruptly and turned.It was O'Brien.

At last they were face to face, and it seemed that his onlyimpulse was to run away. His heart bounded violently. Hewould have been incapable of speaking. O'Brien, however,had continued forward in the same movement, laying afriendly hand for a moment on Winston's arm, so that thetwo of them were walking side by side. He began speak-ing with the peculiar grave courtesy that differentiated himfrom the majority of Inner Party members.

'I had been hoping for an opportunity of talking to you,'he said. 'I was reading one of your Newspeak articles in'The Times' the other day. You take a scholarly interest inNewspeak, I believe?'

Winston had recovered part of his self-possession.'Hardly scholarly' he said. 'I'm only an amateur. It's not my

1984

subject. I have never had anything to do with the actualconstruction of the language.'

'But you write it very elegantly' said O'Brien. "That is notonly my own opinion. I was talking recently to a friend ofyours who is certainly an expert. His name has slipped mymemory for the moment.'

Again Winston's heart stirred painfully. It was incon-ceivable that this was anything other than a reference toSyme. But Syme was not only dead, he was abolished, anunperson. Any identifiable reference to him would havebeen mortally dangerous. O'Brien's remark must obviouslyhave been intended as a signal, a codeword. By sharing asmall act of thoughtcrime he had turned the two of theminto accomplices. They had continued to stroll slowly downthe corridor, but now O'Brien halted. With the curious, dis-arming friendliness that he always managed to put in to thegesture he resettled his spectacles on his nose. Then he wenton:

'What I had really intended to say was that in your articleI noticed you had used two words which have become obso-lete. But they have only become so very recently. Have youseen the tenth edition of the Newspeak Dictionary?'

'No,' said Winston. 'I didn't think it had been issued yet.We are still using the ninth in the Records Department.'

'The tenth edition is not due to appear for some months,I believe. But a few advance copies have been circulated.I have one myself. It might interest you to look at it, per-haps?'

'Very much so,' said Winston, immediately seeing where

this tended.

'Some of the new developments are most ingenious. Thereduction in the number of verbs—that is the point that willappeal to you, I think. Let me see, shall I send a messengerto you with the dictionary? But I am afraid I invariably for-get anything of that kind. Perhaps you could pick it up atmy flat at some time that suited you? Wait. Let me give youmy address.'

They were standing in front of a telescreen. Somewhatabsentmindedly O'Brien felt two of his pockets and thenproduced a small leather-covered notebook and a goldink-pencil. Immediately beneath the telescreen, in such aposition that anyone who was watching at the other end ofthe instrument could read what he was writing, he scribbledan address, tore out the page and handed it to Winston.

'I am usually at home in the evenings,' he said. 'If not, myservant will give you the dictionary'

He was gone, leaving Winston holding the scrap of paper,which this time there was no need to conceal. Neverthelesshe carefully memorized what was written on it, and somehours later dropped it into the memory hole along with amass of other papers.

They had been talking to one another for a couple ofminutes at the most. There was only one meaning that theepisode could possibly have. It had been contrived as a wayof letting Winston know O'Brien's address. This was neces-sary, because except by direct enquiry it was never possibleto discover where anyone lived. There were no directoriesof any kind. 'If you ever want to see me, this is where I can

1984

be found,' was what O'Brien had been saying to him. Per-haps there would even be a message concealed somewherein the dictionary. But at any rate, one thing was certain. Theconspiracy that he had dreamed of did exist, and he hadreached the outer edges of it.

He knew that sooner or later he would obey O'Brien'ssummons. Perhaps tomorrow, perhaps after a long de-lay—he was not certain. What was happening was only theworking-out of a process that had started years ago. Thefirst step had been a secret, involuntary thought, the sec-ond had been the opening of the diary. He had moved fromthoughts to words, and now from words to actions. The laststep was something that would happen in the Ministry ofLove. He had accepted it. The end was contained in the be-ginning. But it was frightening: or, more exactly, it was likea foretaste of death, like being a little less alive. Even whilehe was speaking to O'Brien, when the meaning of the wordshad sunk in, a chilly shuddering feeling had taken posses-sion of his body. He had the sensation of stepping into thedampness of a grave, and it was not much better becausehe had always known that the grave was there and waitingfor him.

Chapter 7

Winston had woken up with his eyes full of tears. Ju-lia rolled sleepily against him, murmuring somethingthat might have been 'What's the matter?'

'I dreamt—' he began, and stopped short. It was too com-plex to be put into words. There was the dream itself, andthere was a memory connected with it that had swum intohis mind in the few seconds after waking.

He lay back with his eyes shut, still sodden in the atmo-sphere of the dream. It was a vast, luminous dream in whichhis whole life seemed to stretch out before him like a land-scape on a summer evening after rain. It had all occurredinside the glass paperweight, but the surface of the glasswas the dome of the sky, and inside the dome everythingwas flooded with clear soft light in which one could see intointerminable distances. The dream had also been compre-hended by—indeed, in some sense it had consisted in—agesture of the arm made by his mother, and made againthirty years later by the Jewish woman he had seen on thenews film, trying to shelter the small boy from the bullets,before the helicopter blew them both to pieces.

'Do you know,' he said, 'that until this moment I believedI had murdered my mother?'

'Why did you murder her?' said Julia, almost asleep.

'I didn't murder her. Not physically'

1984

In the dream he had remembered his last glimpse of hismother, and within a few moments of waking the clusterof small events surrounding it had all come back. It was amemory that he must have deliberately pushed out of hisconsciousness over many years. He was not certain of thedate, but he could not have been less than ten years old, pos-sibly twelve, when it had happened.

His father had disappeared some time earlier, how muchearlier he could not remember. He remembered better therackety, uneasy circumstances of the time: the periodicalpanics about air-raids and the sheltering in Tube stations,the piles of rubble everywhere, the unintelligible proc-lamations posted at street corners, the gangs of youths inshirts all the same colour, the enormous queues outsidethe bakeries, the intermittent machine-gun fire in the dis-tance—above all, the fact that there was never enough toeat. He remembered long afternoons spent with other boysin scrounging round dustbins and rubbish heaps, pickingout the ribs of cabbage leaves, potato peelings, sometimeseven scraps of stale breadcrust from which they carefullyscraped away the cinders; and also in waiting for the pass-ing of trucks which travelled over a certain route and wereknown to carry cattle feed, and which, when they joltedover the bad patches in the road, sometimes spilt a few frag-ments of oil-cake.

When his father disappeared, his mother did not showany surprise or any violent grief, but a sudden change cameover her. She seemed to have become completely spiritless.It was evident even to Winston that she was waiting for

something that she knew must happen. She did everythingthat was needed—cooked, washed, mended, made the bed,swept the floor, dusted the mantelpiece—always very slowlyand with a curious lack of superfluous motion, like an art-ist's lay-figure moving of its own accord. Her large shapelybody seemed to relapse naturally into stillness. For hoursat a time she would sit almost immobile on the bed, nurs-ing his young sister, a tiny, ailing, very silent child of twoor three, with a face made simian by thinness. Very occa-sionally she would take Winston in her arms and press himagainst her for a long time without saying anything. He wasaware, in spite of his youthfulness and selfishness, that thiswas somehow connected with the never-mentioned thingthat was about to happen.

He remembered the room where they lived, a dark, close-smelling room that seemed half filled by a bed with a whitecounterpane. There was a gas ring in the fender, and a shelfwhere food was kept, and on the landing outside there wasa brown earthenware sink, common to several rooms. Heremembered his mother's statuesque body bending over thegas ring to stir at something in a saucepan. Above all heremembered his continuous hunger, and the fierce sordidbattles at mealtimes. He would ask his mother naggingly,over and over again, why there was not more food, he wouldshout and storm at her (he even remembered the tones ofhis voice, which was beginning to break prematurely andsometimes boomed in a peculiar way), or he would attempta snivelling note of pathos in his efforts to get more than hisshare. His mother was quite ready to give him more than

1984

his share. She took it for granted that he, 'the boy', shouldhave the biggest portion; but however much she gave himhe invariably demanded more. At every meal she would be-seech him not to be selfish and to remember that his littlesister was sick and also needed food, but it was no use. Hewould cry out with rage when she stopped ladling, he wouldtry to wrench the saucepan and spoon out of her hands, hewould grab bits from his sister's plate. He knew that he wasstarving the other two, but he could not help it; he even feltthat he had a right to do it. The clamorous hunger in his bel-ly seemed to justify him. Between meals, if his mother didnot stand guard, he was constantly pilfering at the wretchedstore of food on the shelf.

One day a chocolate-ration was issued. There had beenno such issue for weeks or months past. He rememberedquite clearly that precious little morsel of chocolate. It was atwo-ounce slab (they still talked about ounces in those days)between the three of them. It was obvious that it ought tobe divided into three equal parts. Suddenly, as though hewere listening to somebody else, Winston heard himselfdemanding in a loud booming voice that he should be giv-en the whole piece. His mother told him not to be greedy.There was a long, nagging argument that went round andround, with shouts, whines, tears, remonstrances, bargain-ings. His tiny sister, clinging to her mother with both hands,exactly like a baby monkey, sat looking over her shoulder athim with large, mournful eyes. In the end his mother brokeoff three-quarters of the chocolate and gave it to Winston,giving the other quarter to his sister. The little girl took hold

of it and looked at it dully, perhaps not knowing what it was.Winston stood watching her for a moment. Then with asudden swift spring he had snatched the piece of chocolateout of his sister's hand and was fleeing for the door.

'Winston, Winston!' his mother called after him. 'Comeback! Give your sister back her chocolate!'

He stopped, but did not come back. His mother's anx-ious eyes were fixed on his face. Even now he was thinkingabout the thing, he did not know what it was that was onthe point of happening. His sister, conscious of having beenrobbed of something, had set up a feeble wail. His motherdrew her arm round the child and pressed its face againsther breast. Something in the gesture told him that his sis-ter was dying. He turned and fled down the stairs, with thechocolate growing sticky in his hand.

He never saw his mother again. After he had devouredthe chocolate he felt somewhat ashamed of himself andhung about in the streets for several hours, until hungerdrove him home. When he came back his mother had dis-appeared. This was already becoming normal at that time.Nothing was gone from the room except his mother and hissister. They had not taken any clothes, not even his mother'sovercoat. To this day he did not know with any certaintythat his mother was dead. It was perfectly possible that shehad merely been sent to a forced-labour camp. As for hissister, she might have been removed, like Winston himself,to one of the colonies for homeless children (ReclamationCentres, they were called) which had grown up as a resultof the civil war, or she might have been sent to the labour

1984

camp along with his mother, or simply left somewhere orother to die.

The dream was still vivid in his mind, especially the en-veloping protecting gesture of the arm in which its wholemeaning seemed to be contained. His mind went back toanother dream of two months ago. Exactly as his motherhad sat on the dingy whitequilted bed, with the child cling-ing to her, so she had sat in the sunken ship, far underneathhim, and drowning deeper every minute, but still lookingup at him through the darkening water.

He told Julia the story of his mother's disappearance.Without opening her eyes she rolled over and settled herselfinto a more comfortable position.

'I expect you were a beastly little swine in those days,' shesaid indistinctly. 'All children are swine.'

'Yes. But the real point of the story '

From her breathing it was evident that she was goingoff to sleep again. He would have liked to continue talkingabout his mother. He did not suppose, from what he couldremember of her, that she had been an unusual woman, stillless an intelligent one; and yet she had possessed a kind ofnobility, a kind of purity, simply because the standards thatshe obeyed were private ones. Her feelings were her own,and could not be altered from outside. It would not haveoccurred to her that an action which is ineffectual therebybecomes meaningless. If you loved someone, you loved him,and when you had nothing else to give, you still gave himlove. When the last of the chocolate was gone, his motherhad clasped the child in her arms. It was no use, it changed

nothing, it did not produce more chocolate, it did not avertthe child's death or her own; but it seemed natural to her todo it. The refugee woman in the boat had also covered thelittle boy with her arm, which was no more use against thebullets than a sheet of paper. The terrible thing that the Par-ty had done was to persuade you that mere impulses, merefeelings, were of no account, while at the same time robbingyou of all power over the material world. When once youwere in the grip of the Party, what you felt or did not feel,what you did or refrained from doing, made literally no dif-ference. Whatever happened you vanished, and neither younor your actions were ever heard of again. You were liftedclean out of the stream of history. And yet to the peopleof only two generations ago this would not have seemedall-important, because they were not attempting to alterhistory. They were governed by private loyalties which theydid not question. What mattered were individual relation-ships, and a completely helpless gesture, an embrace, a tear,a word spoken to a dying man, could have value in itself.The proles, it suddenly occurred to him, had remained inthis condition. They were not loyal to a party or a country oran idea, they were loyal to one another. For the first time inhis life he did not despise the proles or think of them merelyas an inert force which would one day spring to life and re-generate the world. The proles had stayed human. They hadnot become hardened inside. They had held on to the primi-tive emotions which he himself had to re-learn by consciouseffort. And in thinking this he remembered, without appar-ent relevance, how a few weeks ago he had seen a severed

1984

hand lying on the pavement and had kicked it into the gut-ter as though it had been a cabbage-stalk.

"The proles are human beings,' he said aloud. 'We are nothuman.'

'Why not?' said Julia, who had woken up again.

He thought for a little while. 'Has it ever occurred to you,'he said, 'that the best thing for us to do would be simply towalk out of here before it's too late, and never see each otheragain?'

'Yes, dear, it has occurred to me, several times. But I'mnot going to do it, all the same.'

'We've been lucky' he said 'but it can't last much longer.You're young. You look normal and innocent. If you keepclear of people like me, you might stay alive for another fiftyyears.'

'No. I've thought it all out. What you do, I'm going to do.And don't be too downhearted. I'm rather good at stayingalive.'

'We may be together for another six months—a year—there's no knowing. At the end we're certain to be apart. Doyou realize how utterly alone we shall be? When once theyget hold of us there will be nothing, literally nothing, thateither of us can do for the other. If I confess, they'll shootyou, and if I refuse to confess, they'll shoot you just the same.Nothing that I can do or say, or stop myself from saying, willput off your death for as much as five minutes. Neither of uswill even know whether the other is alive or dead. We shallbe utterly without power of any kind. The one thing thatmatters is that we shouldn't betray one another, although

even that can't make the slightest difference.'

'If you mean confessing,' she said, 'we shall do that, rightenough. Everybody always confesses. You can't help it. Theytorture you.'

'I don't mean confessing. Confession is not betrayal.What you say or do doesn't matter: only feelings matter. Ifthey could make me stop loving you—that would be thereal betrayal.'

She thought it over. 'They can't do that,' she said final-ly 'It's the one thing they can't do. They can make you sayanything—ANYTHING—but they can't make you believeit. They can't get inside you.'

'No,' he said a little more hopefully, 'no; that's quite true.They can't get inside you. If you can FEEL that staying hu-man is worth while, even when it can't have any resultwhatever, you've beaten them.'

He thought of the telescreen with its never-sleeping ear.They could spy upon you night and day, but if you kept yourhead you could still outwit them. With all their clevernessthey had never mastered the secret of finding out what an-other human being was thinking. Perhaps that was less truewhen you were actually in their hands. One did not knowwhat happened inside the Ministry of Love, but it was pos-sible to guess: tortures, drugs, delicate instruments thatregistered your nervous reactions, gradual wearing-downby sleeplessness and solitude and persistent questioning.Facts, at any rate, could not be kept hidden. They could betracked down by enquiry, they could be squeezed out of youby torture. But if the object was not to stay alive but to stay

1984

human, what difference did it ultimately make? They couldnot alter your feelings: for that matter you could not alterthem yourself, even if you wanted to. They could lay bare inthe utmost detail everything that you had done or said orthought; but the inner heart, whose workings were mysteri-ous even to yourself, remained impregnable.

They had done it, they had done it at last!The room they were standing in was long-shaped andsoftly lit. The telescreen was dimmed to a low murmur; therichness of the dark-blue carpet gave one the impression oftreading on velvet. At the far end of the room O'Brien wassitting at a table under a green-shaded lamp, with a mass ofpapers on either side of him. He had not bothered to look upwhen the servant showed Julia and Winston in.

Winston's heart was thumping so hard that he doubtedwhether he would be able to speak. They had done it, theyhad done it at last, was all he could think. It had been a rashact to come here at all, and sheer folly to arrive together;though it was true that they had come by different routesand only met on O'Brien's doorstep. But merely to walk intosuch a place needed an effort of the nerve. It was only onvery rare occasions that one saw inside the dwelling-plac-es of the Inner Party, or even penetrated into the quarterof the town where they lived. The whole atmosphere of thehuge block of flats, the richness and spaciousness of every-thing, the unfamiliar smells of good food and good tobacco,the silent and incredibly rapid lifts sliding up and down, thewhite-jacketed servants hurrying to and fro—everythingwas intimidating. Although he had a good pretext for com-ing here, he was haunted at every step by the fear that a

1984

black-uniformed guard would suddenly appear from roundthe corner, demand his papers, and order him to get out.O'Brien's servant, however, had admitted the two of themwithout demur. He was a small, dark-haired man in a whitejacket, with a diamond-shaped, completely expressionlessface which might have been that of a Chinese. The passagedown which he led them was softly carpeted, with cream-papered walls and white wainscoting, all exquisitely clean.That too was intimidating. Winston could not rememberever to have seen a passageway whose walls were not grimyfrom the contact of human bodies.

O'Brien had a slip of paper between his fingers andseemed to be studying it intently. His heavy face, bent downso that one could see the line of the nose, looked both for-midable and intelligent. For perhaps twenty seconds he satwithout stirring. Then he pulled the speakwrite towardshim and rapped out a message in the hybrid jargon of theMinistries:

'Items one comma five comma seven approved fullwisestop suggestion contained item six doubleplus ridiculousverging crimethink cancel stop unproceed construction-wiseantegettingplusfull estimates machinery overheads stop endmessage.'

He rose deliberately from his chair and came towardsthem across the soundless carpet. A little of the official at-mosphere seemed to have fallen away from him with theNewspeak words, but his expression was grimmer than

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 213

usual, as though he were not pleased at being disturbed. Theterror that Winston already felt was suddenly shot throughby a streak of ordinary embarrassment. It seemed to himquite possible that he had simply made a stupid mistake.For what evidence had he in reality that O'Brien was anykind of political conspirator? Nothing but a flash of the eyesand a single equivocal remark: beyond that, only his ownsecret imaginings, founded on a dream. He could not evenfall back on the pretence that he had come to borrow thedictionary, because in that case Julia's presence was impos-sible to explain. As O'Brien passed the telescreen a thoughtseemed to strike him. He stopped, turned aside and presseda switch on the wall. There was a sharp snap. The voice hadstopped.

Julia uttered a tiny sound, a sort of squeak of surprise.Even in the midst of his panic, Winston was too much takenaback to be able to hold his tongue.

'You can turn it off!' he said.

'Yes,' said O'Brien, 'we can turn it off. We have that privi-lege.'

He was opposite them now. His solid form toweredover the pair of them, and the expression on his face wasstill indecipherable. He was waiting, somewhat sternly, forWinston to speak, but about what? Even now it was quiteconceivable that he was simply a busy man wondering ir-ritably why he had been interrupted. Nobody spoke. Afterthe stopping of the telescreen the room seemed deadly si-lent. The seconds marched past, enormous. With difficultyWinston continued to keep his eyes fixed on O'Brien's. Then

1984

suddenly the grim face broke down into what might havebeen the beginnings of a smile. With his characteristic ges-ture O'Brien resettled his spectacles on his nose.

'Shall I say it, or will you?' he said.

'I will say it,' said Winston promptly. 'That thing is reallyturned off?'

'Yes, everything is turned off. We are alone.'

'We have come here because '

He paused, realizing for the first time the vagueness ofhis own motives. Since he did not in fact know what kindof help he expected from O'Brien, it was not easy to say whyhe had come here. He went on, conscious that what he wassaying must sound both feeble and pretentious:

'We believe that there is some kind of conspiracy, somekind of secret organization working against the Party, andthat you are involved in it. We want to join it and work for it.We are enemies of the Party. We disbelieve in the principlesof Ingsoc. We are thought-criminals. We are also adulter-ers. I tell you this because we want to put ourselves at yourmercy. If you want us to incriminate ourselves in any otherway, we are ready'

He stopped and glanced over his shoulder, with thefeeling that the door had opened. Sure enough, the little yel-low-faced servant had come in without knocking. Winstonsaw that he was carrying a tray with a decanter and glasses.

'Martin is one of us,' said O'Brien impassively. 'Bringthe drinks over here, Martin. Put them on the round table.Have we enough chairs? Then we may as well sit down andtalk in comfort. Bring a chair for yourself, Martin. This is

business. You can stop being a servant for the next ten min-utes.'

The little man sat down, quite at his ease, and yet stillwith a servant-like air, the air of a valet enjoying a priv-ilege. Winston regarded him out of the corner of his eye.It struck him that the man's whole life was playing a part,and that he felt it to be dangerous to drop his assumed per-sonality even for a moment. O'Brien took the decanter bythe neck and filled up the glasses with a dark-red liquid. Itaroused in Winston dim memories of something seen longago on a wall or a hoarding—a vast bottle composed of elec-tric lights which seemed to move up and down and pour itscontents into a glass. Seen from the top the stuff looked al-most black, but in the decanter it gleamed like a ruby. It hada sour-sweet smell. He saw Julia pick up her glass and sniffat it with frank curiosity.

'It is called wine,' said O'Brien with a faint smile. 'Youwill have read about it in books, no doubt. Not much of itgets to the Outer Party, I am afraid.' His face grew solemnagain, and he raised his glass: 'I think it is fitting that weshould begin by drinking a health. To our Leader: To Em-manuel Goldstein.'

Winston took up his glass with a certain eagerness. Winewas a thing he had read and dreamed about. Like the glasspaperweight or Mr Charrington's half-remembered rhymes,it belonged to the vanished, romantic past, the olden timeas he liked to call it in his secret thoughts. For some reasonhe had always thought of wine as having an intensely sweettaste, like that of blackberry jam and an immediate intoxi-

1984

eating effect. Actually, when he came to swallow it, the stuffwas distinctly disappointing. The truth was that after yearsof gin-drinking he could barely taste it. He set down theempty glass.

"Then there is such a person as Goldstein?' he said.

'Yes, there is such a person, and he is alive. Where, I donot know.'

'And the conspiracy—the organization? Is it real? It is notsimply an invention of the Thought Police?'

'No, it is real. The Brotherhood, we call it. You will neverlearn much more about the Brotherhood than that it existsand that you belong to it. I will come back to that pres-ently' He looked at his wrist-watch. 'It is unwise even formembers of the Inner Party to turn off the telescreen formore than half an hour. You ought not to have come heretogether, and you will have to leave separately. You, com-rade'—he bowed his head to Julia—'will leave first. We haveabout twenty minutes at our disposal. You will understandthat I must start by asking you certain questions. In generalterms, what are you prepared to do?'

Anything that we are capable of,' said Winston.

O'Brien had turned himself a little in his chair so that hewas facing Winston. He almost ignored Julia, seeming totake it for granted that Winston could speak for her. For amoment the lids flitted down over his eyes. He began askinghis questions in a low, expressionless voice, as though thiswere a routine, a sort of catechism, most of whose answerswere known to him already.

'You are prepared to give your lives?'

Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com

'Yes.'

'You are prepared to commit murder?'

'Yes.'

'To commit acts of sabotage which may cause the deathof hundreds of innocent people?'

'Yes.'

'To betray your country to foreign powers?'

'Yes.'

'You are prepared to cheat, to forge, to blackmail, to cor-rupt the minds of children, to distribute habit-formingdrugs, to encourage prostitution, to disseminate venerealdiseases—to do anything which is likely to cause demoral-ization and weaken the power of the Party?'

'Yes.'

'If, for example, it would somehow serve our interests tothrow sulphuric acid in a child's face—are you prepared todo that?'

'Yes.'

'You are prepared to lose your identity and live out therest of your life as a waiter or a dock-worker?'

'Yes.'

'You are prepared to commit suicide, if and when we or-der you to do so?'

'Yes.'

'You are prepared, the two of you, to separate and neversee one another again?'

'No!' broke in Julia.

It appeared to Winston that a long time passed beforehe answered. For a moment he seemed even to have been

1984

deprived of the power of speech. His tongue worked sound-lessly, forming the opening syllables first of one word, thenof the other, over and over again. Until he had said it, hedid not know which word he was going to say. 'No,' he saidfinally.

'You did well to tell me,' said O'Brien. 'It is necessary forus to know everything.'

He turned himself toward Julia and added in a voicewith somewhat more expression in it:

'Do you understand that even if he survives, it may beas a different person? We may be obliged to give him a newidentity. His face, his movements, the shape of his hands,the colour of his hair—even his voice would be different.And you yourself might have become a different person.Our surgeons can alter people beyond recognition. Some-times it is necessary. Sometimes we even amputate a limb.'

Winston could not help snatching another sidelongglance at Martin's Mongolian face. There were no scarsthat he could see. Julia had turned a shade paler, so thather freckles were showing, but she faced O'Brien boldly. Shemurmured something that seemed to be assent.

'Good. Then that is settled.'

There was a silver box of cigarettes on the table. With arather absent-minded air O'Brien pushed them towards theothers, took one himself, then stood up and began to paceslowly to and fro, as though he could think better standing.They were very good cigarettes, very thick and well-packed,with an unfamiliar silkiness in the paper. O'Brien looked athis wrist-watch again.

'You had better go back to your Pantry, Martin,' he said.'I shall switch on in a quarter of an hour. Take a good lookat these comrades' faces before you go. You will be seeingthem again. I may not.'

Exactly as they had done at the front door, the little man'sdark eyes flickered over their faces. There was not a traceof friendliness in his manner. He was memorizing theirappearance, but he felt no interest in them, or appearedto feel none. It occurred to Winston that a synthetic facewas perhaps incapable of changing its expression. Withoutspeaking or giving any kind of salutation, Martin went out,closing the door silently behind him. O'Brien was strollingup and down, one hand in the pocket of his black overalls,the other holding his cigarette.

'You understand,' he said, 'that you will be fighting inthe dark. You will always be in the dark. You will receiveorders and you will obey them, without knowing why. LaterI shall send you a book from which you will learn the truenature of the society we live in, and the strategy by whichwe shall destroy it. When you have read the book, you willbe full members of the Brotherhood. But between the gen-eral aims that we are fighting for and the immedi ate tasksof the moment, you will never know anything. I tell youthat the Brotherhood exists, but I cannot tell you wheth-er it numbers a hundred members, or ten million. Fromyour personal knowledge you will never be able to say thatit numbers even as many as a dozen. You will have threeor four contacts, who will be renewed from time to timeas they disappear. As this was your first contact, it will be

1984

preserved. When you receive orders, they will come fromme. If we find it necessary to communicate with you, it willbe through Martin. When you are finally caught, you willconfess. That is unavoidable. But you will have very littleto confess, other than your own actions. You will not beable to betray more than a handful of unimportant people.Probably you will not even betray me. By that time I may bedead, or I shall have become a different person, with a dif-ferent face.'

He continued to move to and fro over the soft carpet. Inspite of the bulkiness of his body there was a remarkablegrace in his movements. It came out even in the gesturewith which he thrust a hand into his pocket, or manipu-lated a cigarette. More even than of strength, he gave animpression of confidence and of an understanding tingedby irony. However much in earnest he might be, he hadnothing of the single-mindedness that belongs to a fanatic.When he spoke of murder, suicide, venereal disease, am-putated limbs, and altered faces, it was with a faint air ofpersiflage. 'This is unavoidable,' his voice seemed to say;'this is what we have got to do, unflinchingly. But this isnot what we shall be doing when life is worth living again.'A wave of admiration, almost of worship, flowed out fromWinston towards O'Brien. For the moment he had forgot-ten the shadowy figure of Goldstein. When you looked atO'Brien's powerful shoulders and his blunt-featured face, sougly and yet so civilized, it was impossible to believe thathe could be defeated. There was no stratagem that he wasnot equal to, no danger that he could not foresee. Even Julia

seemed to be impressed. She had let her cigarette go out andwas listening intently. O'Brien went on:

'You will have heard rumours of the existence of theBrotherhood. No doubt you have formed your own pictureof it. You have imagined, probably, a huge underworld ofconspirators, meeting secretly in cellars, scribbling mes-sages on walls, recognizing one another by codewords or byspecial movements of the hand. Nothing of the kind exists.The members of the Brotherhood have no way of recogniz-ing one another, and it is impossible for any one member tobe aware of the identity of more than a few others. Gold-stein himself, if he fell into the hands of the Thought Police,could not give them a complete list of members, or any in-formation that would lead them to a complete list. No suchlist exists. The Brotherhood cannot be wiped out because itis not an organization in the ordinary sense. Nothing holdsit together except an idea which is indestructible. You willnever have anything to sustain you, except the idea. Youwill get no comradeship and no encouragement. When fi-nally you are caught, you will get no help. We never helpour members. At most, when it is absolutely necessary thatsomeone should be silenced, we are occasionally able tosmuggle a razor blade into a prisoner's cell. You will haveto get used to living without results and without hope. Youwill work for a while, you will be caught, you will confess,and then you will die. Those are the only results that youwill ever see. There is no possibility that any perceptiblechange will happen within our own lifetime. We are thedead. Our only true life is in the future. We shall take part

1984

in it as handfuls of dust and splinters of bone. But how faraway that future may be, there is no knowing. It might bea thousand years. At present nothing is possible except toextend the area of sanity little by little. We cannot act col-lectively. We can only spread our knowledge outwards fromindividual to individual, generation after generation. In theface of the Thought Police there is no other way'

He halted and looked for the third time at his wrist-watch.

'It is almost time for you to leave, comrade,' he said to Ju-lia. 'Wait. The decanter is still half full.'

He filled the glasses and raised his own glass by thestem.

'What shall it be this time?' he said, still with the samefaint suggestion of irony. 'To the confusion of the ThoughtPolice? To the death of Big Brother? To humanity? To thefuture?'

'To the past,' said Winston.

'The past is more important,' agreed O'Brien gravely.

They emptied their glasses, and a moment later Juliastood up to go. O'Brien took a small box from the top of acabinet and handed her a flat white tablet which he told herto place on her tongue. It was important, he said, not to goout smelling of wine: the lift attendants were very obser-vant. As soon as the door had shut behind her he appearedto forget her existence. He took another pace or two up anddown, then stopped.

'There are details to be settled,' he said. 'I assume thatyou have a hiding-place of some kind?'

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 223

Winston explained about the room over Mr Char-rington's shop.

"That will do for the moment. Later we will arrangesomething else for you. It is important to change one's hid-ing-place frequently. Meanwhile I shall send you a copy ofTHE BOOK'—even O'Brien, Winston noticed, seemed topronounce the words as though they were in italics—'Gold-stein's book, you understand, as soon as possible. It maybe some days before I can get hold of one. There are notmany in existence, as you can imagine. The Thought Policehunt them down and destroy them almost as fast as we canproduce them. It makes very little difference. The book isindestructible. If the last copy were gone, we could repro-duce it almost word for word. Do you carry a brief-case towork with you?' he added.

'As a rule, yes.'

'What is it like?'

'Black, very shabby. With two straps.'

'Black, two straps, very shabby—good. One day in thefairly near future—I cannot give a date—one of the messag-es among your morning's work will contain a misprintedword, and you will have to ask for a repeat. On the followingday you will go to work without your brief-case. At sometime during the day, in the street, a man will touch you onthe arm and say 'I think you have dropped your brief-case.'The one he gives you will contain a copy of Goldstein's book.You will return it within fourteen days.'

They were silent for a moment.

'There are a couple of minutes before you need go,' said

O'Brien. 'We shall meet again—if we do meet again '

Winston looked up at him. 'In the place where there is nodarkness?' he said hesitantly.

O'Brien nodded without appearance of surprise. 'In theplace where there is no darkness,' he said, as though he hadrecognized the allusion. 'And in the meantime, is there any-thing that you wish to say before you leave? Any message?Any question?.'

Winston thought. There did not seem to be any furtherquestion that he wanted to ask: still less did he feel anyimpulse to utter high-sounding generalities. Instead of any-thing directly connected with O'Brien or the Brotherhood,there came into his mind a sort of composite picture of thedark bedroom where his mother had spent her last days,and the little room over Mr Charrington's shop, and theglass paperweight, and the steel engraving in its rosewoodframe. Almost at random he said:

'Did you ever happen to hear an old rhyme that begins'Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's'?'

Again O'Brien nodded. With a sort of grave courtesy hecompleted the stanza:

'Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's,You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin's,When willyoupay me? say the bells of Old Bailey,When I grow rich, say the bells of Shoreditch.'

'You knew the last line!' said Winston.

'Yes, I knew the last line. And now, I am afraid, it is time

for you to go. But wait. You had better let me give you oneof these tablets.'

As Winston stood up O'Brien held out a hand. His pow-erful grip crushed the bones of Winston's palm. At thedoor Winston looked back, but O'Brien seemed already tobe in process of putting him out of mind. He was waitingwith his hand on the switch that controlled the telescreen.Beyond him Winston could see the writing-table with itsgreen-shaded lamp and the speakwrite and the wire basketsdeep-laden with papers. The incident was closed. Withinthirty seconds, it occurred to him, O'Brien would be back athis interrupted and important work on behalf of the Party.

Chapter 9

Winston was gelatinous with fatigue. Gelatinous wasthe right word. It had come into his head spontane-ously. His body seemed to have not only the weakness of ajelly, but its translucency He felt that if he held up his handhe would be able to see the light through it. All the bloodand lymph had been drained out of him by an enormousdebauch of work, leaving only a frail structure of nerves,bones, and skin. All sensations seemed to be magnified. Hisoveralls fretted his shoulders, the pavement tickled his feet,even the opening and closing of a hand was an effort thatmade his joints creak.

He had worked more than ninety hours in five days. Sohad everyone else in the Ministry. Now it was all over, andhe had literally nothing to do, no Party work of any descrip -tion, until tomorrow morning. He could spend six hours inthe hiding-place and another nine in his own bed. Slowly, inmild afternoon sunshine, he walked up a dingy street in thedirection of Mr Charrington's shop, keeping one eye openfor the patrols, but irrationally convinced that this after-noon there was no danger of anyone interfering with him.The heavy brief-case that he was carrying bumped againsthis knee at each step, sending a tingling sensation up anddown the skin of his leg. Inside it was the book, which hehad now had in his possession for six days and had not yet

opened, nor even looked at.

On the sixth day of Hate Week, after the processions, thespeeches, the shouting, the singing, the banners, the posters,the films, the waxworks, the rolling of drums and squeal-ing of trumpets, the tramp of marching feet, the grindingof the caterpillars of tanks, the roar of massed planes, thebooming of guns—after six days of this, when the great or-gasm was quivering to its climax and the general hatred ofEurasia had boiled up into such delirium that if the crowdcould have got their hands on the 2,000 Eurasian war-crim-inals who were to be publicly hanged on the last day of theproceedings, they would unquestionably have torn themto pieces—at just this moment it had been announced thatOceania was not after all at war with Eurasia. Oceania wasat war with Eastasia. Eurasia was an ally.

There was, of course, no admission that any change hadtaken place. Merely it became known, with extreme sud-denness and everywhere at once, that Eastasia and notEurasia was the enemy. Winston was taking part in a dem-onstration in one of the central London squares at themoment when it happened. It was night, and the white fac-es and the scarlet banners were luridly floodlit. The squarewas packed with several thousand people, including a blockof about a thousand schoolchildren in the uniform of theSpies. On a scarlet-draped platform an orator of the InnerParty, a small lean man with disproportionately long armsand a large bald skull over which a few lank locks strag-gled, was haranguing the crowd. A little Rumpelstiltskinfigure, contorted with hatred, he gripped the neck of the

1984

microphone with one hand while the other, enormous atthe end of a bony arm, clawed the air menacingly above hishead. His voice, made metallic by the amplifiers, boomedforth an endless catalogue of atrocities, massacres, depor-tations, lootings, rapings, torture of prisoners, bombingof civilians, lying propaganda, unjust aggressions, brokentreaties. It was almost impossible to listen to him withoutbeing first convinced and then maddened. At every few mo-ments the fury of the crowd boiled over and the voice of thespeaker was drowned by a wild beast-like roaring that roseuncontrollably from thousands of throats. The most sav-age yells of all came from the schoolchildren. The speechhad been proceeding for perhaps twenty minutes when amessenger hurried on to the platform and a scrap of paperwas slipped into the speaker's hand. He unrolled and read itwithout pausing in his speech. Nothing altered in his voiceor manner, or in the content of what he was saying, but sud-denly the names were different. Without words said, a waveof understanding rippled through the crowd. Oceania wasat war with Eastasia! The next moment there was a tremen-dous commotion. The banners and posters with which thesquare was decorated were all wrong! Quite half of themhad the wrong faces on them. It was sabotage! The agents ofGoldstein had been at work! There was a riotous interludewhile posters were ripped from the walls, banners torn toshreds and trampled underfoot. The Spies performed prod-igies of activity in clambering over the rooftops and cuttingthe streamers that fluttered from the chimneys. But withintwo or three minutes it was all over. The orator, still gripping

the neck of the microphone, his shoulders hunched forward,his free hand clawing at the air, had gone straight on withhis speech. One minute more, and the feral roars of ragewere again bursting from the crowd. The Hate continuedexactly as before, except that the target had been changed.

The thing that impressed Winston in looking back wasthat the speaker had switched from one line to the other ac-tually in midsentence, not only without a pause, but withouteven breaking the syntax. But at the moment he had otherthings to preoccupy him. It was during the moment of dis-order while the posters were being torn down that a manwhose face he did not see had tapped him on the shoulderand said, 'Excuse me, I think you've dropped your brief-case.' He took the brief-case abstractedly, without speaking.He knew that it would be days before he had an opportuni-ty to look inside it. The instant that the demonstration wasover he went straight to the Ministry of Truth, though thetime was now nearly twenty-three hours. The entire staffof the Ministry had done likewise. The orders already issu-ing from the telescreen, recalling them to their posts, werehardly necessary.

Oceania was at war with Eastasia: Oceania had alwaysbeen at war with Eastasia. A large part of the political lit-erature of five years was now completely obsolete. Reportsand records of all kinds, newspapers, books, pamphlets,films, sound-tracks, photographs—all had to be rectifiedat lightning speed. Although no directive was ever issued,it was known that the chiefs of the Department intendedthat within one week no reference to the war with Eurasia,

1984

or the alliance with Eastasia, should remain in existenceanywhere. The work was overwhelming, all the more sobecause the processes that it involved could not be calledby their true names. Everyone in the Records Departmentworked eighteen hours in the twenty-four, with two three-hour snatches of sleep. Mattresses were brought up fromthe cellars and pitched all over the corridors: meals con-sisted of sandwiches and Victory Coffee wheeled roundon trolleys by attendants from the canteen. Each time thatWinston broke off for one of his spells of sleep he tried toleave his desk clear of work, and each time that he crawledback sticky-eyed and aching, it was to find that anothershower of paper cylinders had covered the desk like a snow-drift, halfburying the speakwrite and overflowing on to thefloor, so that the first job was always to stack them into aneat enough pile to give him room to work. What was worstof all was that the work was by no means purely mechanical.Often it was enough merely to substitute one name for an-other, but any detailed report of events demanded care andimagination. Even the geographical knowledge that oneneeded in transferring the war from one part of the worldto another was considerable.

By the third day his eyes ached unbearably and hisspectacles needed wiping every few minutes. It was likestruggling with some crushing physical task, somethingwhich one had the right to refuse and which one was never-theless neurotically anxious to accomplish. In so far as hehad time to remember it, he was not troubled by the fact thatevery word he murmured into the speakwrite, every stroke

of his ink-pencil, was a deliberate lie. He was as anxious asanyone else in the Department that the forgery should beperfect. On the morning of the sixth day the dribble of cyl-inders slowed down. For as much as half an hour nothingcame out of the tube; then one more cylinder, then nothing.Everywhere at about the same time the work was easing off.A deep and as it were secret sigh went through the Depart-ment. A mighty deed, which could never be mentioned, hadbeen achieved. It was now impossible for any human beingto prove by documentary evidence that the war with Eurasiahad ever happened. At twelve hundred it was unexpectedlyannounced that all workers in the Ministry were free tilltomorrow morning. Winston, still carrying the brief-casecontaining the book, which had remained between his feetwhile he worked and under his body while he slept, wenthome, shaved himself, and almost fell asleep in his bath, al-though the water was barely more than tepid.

With a sort of voluptuous creaking in his joints heclimbed the stair above Mr Charrington's shop. He wastired, but not sleepy any longer. He opened the window, litthe dirty little oilstove and put on a pan of water for coffee.Julia would arrive presently: meanwhile there was the book.He sat down in the sluttish armchair and undid the strapsof the brief-case.

A heavy black volume, amateurishly bound, with noname or title on the cover. The print also looked slightlyirregular. The pages were worn at the edges, and fell apart,easily, as though the book had passed through many hands.The inscription on the title-page ran:

THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OFOLIGARCHICAL COLLECTIVISM

by

Emmanuel Goldstein

Winston began reading:

Chapter I

Ignorance is Strength

Throughout recorded time, and probably since the endof the Neolithic Age, there have been three kinds of peoplein the world, the High, the Middle, and the Low. They havebeen subdivided in many ways, they have borne count-less different names, and their relative numbers, as well astheir attitude towards one another, have varied from age toage: but the essential structure of society has never altered.Even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocablechanges, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, justas a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium, howeverfar it is pushed one way or the other.

The aims of these groups are entirely irreconcilable...

Winston stopped reading, chiefly in order to appreciatethe fact that he was reading, in comfort and safety. He wasalone: no telescreen, no ear at the keyhole, no nervous im-pulse to glance over his shoulder or cover the page with hishand. The sweet summer air played against his cheek. Fromsomewhere far away there floated the faint shouts of chil-

dren: in the room itself there was no sound except the insectvoice of the clock. He settled deeper into the arm-chair andput his feet up on the fender. It was bliss, it was eternity.Suddenly, as one sometimes does with a book of which oneknows that one will ultimately read and re-read every word,he opened it at a different place and found himself at Chap-ter III. He went on reading:

Chapter III

War is Peace

The splitting up of the world into three great super-stateswas an event which could be and indeed was foreseenbefore the middle of the twentieth century. With the ab-sorption of Europe by Russia and of the British Empire bythe United States, two of the three existing powers, Eurasiaand Oceania, were already effectively in being. The third,Eastasia, only emerged as a distinct unit after another de-cade of confused fighting. The frontiers between the threesuper-states are in some places arbitrary, and in others theyfluctuate according to the fortunes of war, but in generalthey follow geographical lines. Eurasia comprises the wholeof the northern part of the European and Asiatic land-mass,from Portugal to the Bering Strait. Oceania comprises theAmericas, the Atlantic islands including the British Isles,Australasia, and the southern portion of Africa. Eastasia,smaller than the others and with a less definite westernfrontier, comprises China and the countries to the south of

1984

it, the Japanese islands and a large but fluctuating portionof Manchuria, Mongolia, and Tibet.

In one combination or another, these three super-statesare permanently at war, and have been so for the past twen-ty-five years. War, however, is no longer the desperate,annihilating struggle that it was in the early decades of thetwentieth century. It is a warfare of limited aims betweencombatants who are unable to destroy one another, have nomaterial cause for fighting and are not divided by any genu-ine ideological difference This is not to say that either theconduct of war, or the prevailing attitude towards it, has be-come less bloodthirsty or more chivalrous. On the contrary,war hysteria is continuous and universal in all countries,and such acts as raping, looting, the slaughter of children,the reduction of whole populations to slavery, and reprisalsagainst prisoners which extend even to boiling and buryingalive, are looked upon as normal, and, when they are com-mitted by one's own side and not by the enemy, meritorious.But in a physical sense war involves very small numbers ofpeople, mostly highly-trained specialists, and causes com-paratively few casualties. The fighting, when there is any,takes place on the vague frontiers whose whereabouts theaverage man can only guess at, or round the Floating For-tresses which guard strategic spots on the sea lanes. In thecentres of civilization war means no more than a contin-uous shortage of consumption goods, and the occasionalcrash of a rocket bomb which may cause a few scores ofdeaths. War has in fact changed its character. More exactly,the reasons for which war is waged have changed in their

order of importance. Motives which were already presentto some small extent in the great wars of the early twentiethcentuury have now become dominant and are consciouslyrecognized and acted upon.

To understand the nature of the present war—for in spiteof the regrouping which occurs every few years, it is al-ways the same war—one must realize in the first place thatit is impossible for it to be decisive. None of the three su-per-states could be definitively conquered even by the othertwo in combination. They are too evenly matched, and theirnatural defences are too formidable. Eurasia is protected byits vast land spaces, Oceania by the width of the Atlanticand the Pacific, Eastasia by the fecundity and indus tri-ousness of its inhabitants. Secondly, there is no longer, ina material sense, anything to fight about. With the estab-lishment of self-contained economies, in which productionand consumption are geared to one another, the scramblefor markets which was a main cause of previous wars hascome to an end, while the competition for raw materials isno longer a matter of life and death. In any case each of thethree super-states is so vast that it can obtain almost all thematerials that it needs within its own boundaries. In so faras the war has a direct economic purpose, it is a war for la-bour power. Between the frontiers of the super-states, andnot permanently in the possession of any of them, there liesa rough quadrilateral with its corners at Tangier, Brazza-ville, Darwin, and Hong Kong, containing within it abouta fifth of the population of the earth. It is for the posses-sion of these thickly-populated regions, and of the northern

ice-cap, that the three powers are constantly struggling. Inpractice no one power ever controls the whole of the disput-ed area. Portions of it are constantly changing hands, andit is the chance of seizing this or that fragment by a sud-den stroke of treachery that dictates the endless changes ofalignment.

All of the disputed territories contain valuable minerals,and some of them yield important vegetable products suchas rubber which in colder climates it is necessary to syn-thesize by comparatively expensive methods. But above allthey contain a bottomless reserve of cheap labour. Which-ever power controls equatorial Africa, or the countriesof the Middle East, or Southern India, or the IndonesianArchipelago, disposes also of the bodies of scores or hun-dreds of millions of ill-paid and hard-working coolies. Theinhabitants of these areas, reduced more or less openly tothe status of slaves, pass continually from conqueror to con-queror, and are expended like so much coal or oil in therace to turn out more armaments, to capture more territory,to control more labour power, to turn out more armaments,to capture more territory, and so on indefinitely. It shouldbe noted that the fighting never really moves beyond theedges of the disputed areas. The frontiers of Eurasia flowback and forth between the basin of the Congo and thenorthern shore of the Mediterranean; the islands of the In-dian Ocean and the Pacific are constantly being capturedand recaptured by Oceania or by Eastasia; in Mongolia thedividing line between Eurasia and Eastasia is never stable;round the Pole all three powers lay claim to enormous terri-

tories which in fact are largely unihabited and unexplored:but the balance of power always remains roughly even, andthe territory which forms the heartland of each super-statealways remains inviolate. Moreover, the labour of the ex-ploited peoples round the Equator is not really necessary tothe world's economy. They add nothing to the wealth of theworld, since whatever they produce is used for purposes ofwar, and the object of waging a war is always to be in a bet-ter position in which to wage another war. By their labourthe slave populations allow the tempo of continuous war-fare to be speeded up. But if they did not exist, the structureof world society, and the process by which it maintains it-self, would not be essentially different.

The primary aim of modern warfare (in accordancewith the principles of DOUBLETHINK, this aim is simul-taneously recognized and not recognized by the directingbrains of the Inner Party) is to use up the products of themachine without raising the general standard of living.Ever since the end of the nineteenth century, the problem ofwhat to do with the surplus of consumption goods has beenlatent in industrial society. At present, when few human be-ings even have enough to eat, this problem is obviously noturgent, and it might not have become so, even if no artifi-cial processes of destruction had been at work. The worldof today is a bare, hungry, dilapidated place compared withthe world that existed before 1914, and still more so if com-pared with the imaginary future to which the people of thatperiod looked forward. In the early twentieth century, thevision of a future society unbelievably rich, leisured, orderly,

238 1984

and efficient—a glittering antiseptic world of glass and steeland snow-white concrete—was part of the consciousness ofnearly every literate person. Science and technology weredeveloping at a prodigious speed, and it seemed natural toassume that they would go on developing. This failed tohappen, partly because of the impoverishment caused by along series of wars and revolutions, partly because scientificand technical progress depended on the empirical habit ofthought, which could not survive in a strictly regimentedsociety. As a whole the world is more primitive today than itwas fifty years ago. Certain backward areas have advanced,and various devices, always in some way connected withwarfare and police espionage, have been developed, butexperiment and invention have largely stopped, and theravages of the atomic war of the nineteen-fifties have nev-er been fully repaired. Nevertheless the dangers inherentin the machine are still there. From the moment when themachine first made its appearance it was clear to all think-ing people that the need for human drudgery, and thereforeto a great extent for human inequality, had disappeared. Ifthe machine were used deliberately for that end, hunger,overwork, dirt, illiteracy, and disease could be eliminatedwithin a few generations. And in fact, without being usedfor any such purpose, but by a sort of automatic process—by producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible notto distribute—the machine did raise the living standardsof the average humand being very greatly over a period ofabout fifty years at the end of the nineteenth and the begin-ning of the twentieth centuries.

But it was also clear that an all-round increase in wealththreatened the destruction—indeed, in some sense was thedestruction—of a hierarchical society. In a world in whicheveryone worked short hours, had enough to eat, lived in ahouse with a bathroom and a refrigerator, and possessed amotor-car or even an aeroplane, the most obvious and per-haps the most important form of inequality would alreadyhave disappeared. If it once became general, wealth wouldconfer no distinction. It was possible, no doubt, to imaginea society in which WEALTH, in the sense of personal pos-sessions and luxuries, should be evenly distributed, whilePOWER remained in the hands of a small privileged caste.But in practice such a society could not long remain sta-ble. For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, thegreat mass of human beings who are normally stupefied bypoverty would become literate and would learn to think forthemselves; and when once they had done this, they wouldsooner or later realize that the privileged minority had nofunction, and they would sweep it away. In the long run,a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of pov-erty and ignorance. To return to the agricultural past, assome thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth cen-tury dreamed of doing, was not a practicable solution. Itconflicted with the tendency towards mechanization whichhad become quasi-instinctive throughout almost the wholeworld, and moreover, any country which remained indus-trially backward was helpless in a military sense and wasbound to be dominated, directly or indirectly, by its moreadvanced rivals.

1984

Nor was it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses inpoverty by restricting the output of goods. This happenedto a great extent during the final phase of capitalism, rough-ly between 1920 and 1940. The economy of many countrieswas allowed to stagnate, land went out of cultivation, capitalequipment was not added to, great blocks of the popula-tion were prevented from working and kept half alive byState charity. But this, too, entailed military weakness, andsince the privations it inflicted were obviously unneces-sary, it made opposition inevitable. The problem was howto keep the wheels of industry turning without increasingthe real wealth of the world. Goods must be produced, butthey must not be distributed. And in practice the only wayof achieving this was by continuous warfare.

The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily ofhuman lives, but of the products of human labour. War is away of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere,or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which mightotherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, andhence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weaponsof war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is stilla convenient way of expending labour power without pro-ducing anything that can be consumed. A Floating Fortress,for example, has locked up in it the labour that would buildseveral hundred cargo-ships. Ultimately it is scrapped asobsolete, never having brought any material benefit to any-body, and with further enormous labours another FloatingFortress is built. In principle the war effort is always soplanned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meet-

ing the bare needs of the population. In practice the needsof the population are always underestimated, with the re-sult that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessitiesof life; but this is looked on as an advantage. It is deliberatepolicy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere nearthe brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcityincreases the importance of small privileges and thus mag-nifies the distinction between one group and another. Bythe standards of the early twentieth century, even a mem-ber of the Inner Party lives an austere, laborious kind of life.Nevertheless, the few luxuries that he does enjoy his large,well-appointed flat, the better texture of his clothes, the bet-ter quality of his food and drink and tobacco, his two orthree servants, his private motor-car or helicopter—set himin a different world from a member of the Outer Party, andthe members of the Outer Party have a similar advantagein comparison with the submerged masses whom we call'the proles'. The social atmosphere is that of a besieged city,where the possession of a lump of horseflesh makes the dif-ference between wealth and poverty. And at the same timethe consciousness of being at war, and therefore in danger,makes the handing-over of all power to a small caste seemthe natural, unavoidable condition of survival.

War, it will be seen, accomplishes the necessary destruc-tion, but accomplishes it in a psychologically acceptable way.In principle it would be quite simple to waste the surpluslabour of the world by building temples and pyramids, bydigging holes and filling them up again, or even by produc-ing vast quantities of goods and then setting fire to them.

1984

But this would provide only the economic and not the emo-tional basis for a hierarchical society. What is concernedhere is not the morale of masses, whose attitude is unim-portant so long as they are kept steadily at work, but themorale of the Party itself. Even the humblest Party memberis expected to be competent, industrious, and even intel-ligent within narrow limits, but it is also necessary that heshould be a credulous and ignorant fanatic whose prevailingmoods are fear, hatred, adulation, and orgiastic triumph. Inother words it is necessary that he should have the mental-ity appropriate to a state of war. It does not matter whetherthe war is actually happening, and, since no decisive victoryis possible, it does not matter whether the war is going wellor badly. All that is needed is that a state of war should ex-ist. The splitting of the intelligence which the Party requiresof its members, and which is more easily achieved in an at-mosphere of war, is now almost universal, but the higherup the ranks one goes, the more marked it becomes. It isprecisely in the Inner Party that war hysteria and hatred ofthe enemy are strongest. In his capacity as an administra-tor, it is often necessary for a member of the Inner Party toknow that this or that item of war news is untruthful, andhe may often be aware that the entire war is spurious and iseither not happening or is being waged for purposes quiteother than the declared ones: but such knowledge is easilyneutralized by the technique of DOUBLETHINK. Mean-while no Inner Party member wavers for an instant in hismystical belief that the war is real, and that it is bound toend victoriously, with Oceania the undisputed master of

the entire world.

All members of the Inner Party believe in this comingconquest as an article of faith. It is to be achieved either bygradually acquiring more and more territory and so build-ing up an overwhelming preponderance of power, or bythe discovery of some new and unanswerable weapon. Thesearch for new weapons continues unceasingly, and is oneof the very few remaining activities in which the inventiveor speculative type of mind can find any outlet. In Ocea-nia at the present day, Science, in the old sense, has almostceased to exist. In Newspeak there is no word for 'Science'.The empirical method of thought, on which all the scien-tific achievements of the past were founded, is opposed tothe most fundamental principles of Ingsoc. And even tech-nological progress only happens when its products can insome way be used for the diminution of human liberty. Inall the useful arts the world is either standing still or go-ing backwards. The fields are cultivated with horse-ploughswhile books are written by machinery. But in matters ofvital importance—meaning, in effect, war and police espio-nage—the empirical approach is still encouraged, or at leasttolerated. The two aims of the Party are to conquer the wholesurface of the earth and to extinguish once and for all thepossibility of independent thought. There are therefore twogreat problems which the Party is concerned to solve. Oneis how to discover, against his will, what another human be-ing is thinking, and the other is how to kill several hundredmillion people in a few seconds without giving warning be-forehand. In so far as scientific research still continues, this

1984

is its subject matter. The scientist of today is either a mixtureof psychologist and inquisitor, studying with real ordinaryminuteness the meaning of facial expressions, gestures, andtones of voice, and testing the truth-producing effects ofdrugs, shock therapy, hypnosis, and physical torture; or heis chemist, physicist, or biologist concerned only with suchbranches of his special subject as are relevant to the takingof life. In the vast laboratories of the Ministry of Peace, andin the experimental stations hidden in the Brazilian forests,or in the Australian desert, or on lost islands of the Ant-arctic, the teams of experts are indefatigably at work. Someare concerned simply with planning the logistics of futurewars; others devise larger and larger rocket bombs, moreand more powerful explosives, and more and more impen-etrable armour-plating; others search for new and deadliergases, or for soluble poisons capable of being produced insuch quantities as to destroy the vegetation of whole con-tinents, or for breeds of disease germs immunized againstall possible antibodies; others strive to produce a vehiclethat shall bore its way under the soil like a submarine un-der the water, or an aeroplane as independent of its baseas a sailing-ship; others explore even remoter possibilitiessuch as focusing the sun's rays through lenses suspendedthousands of kilometres away in space, or producing artifi-cial earthquakes and tidal waves by tapping the heat at theearth's centre.

But none of these projects ever comes anywhere near re-alization, and none of the three super-states ever gains asignificant lead on the others. What is more remarkable is

that all three powers already possess, in the atomic bomb,a weapon far more powerful than any that their presentresearches are likely to discover. Although the Party, ac-cording to its habit, claims the invention for itself, atomicbombs first appeared as early as the nineteen-forties, andwere first used on a large scale about ten years later. At thattime some hundreds of bombs were dropped on indus-trial centres, chiefly in European Russia, Western Europe,and North America. The effect was to convince the rulinggroups of all countries that a few more atomic bombs wouldmean the end of organized society, and hence of their ownpower. Thereafter, although no formal agreement was evermade or hinted at, no more bombs were dropped. All threepowers merely continue to produce atomic bombs and storethem up against the decisive opportunity which they allbelieve will come sooner or later. And meanwhile the artof war has remained almost stationary for thirty or fortyyears. Helicopters are more used than they were formerly,bombing planes have been largely superseded by self-pro-pelled projectiles, and the fragile movable battleship hasgiven way to the almost unsinkable Floating Fortress; butotherwise there has been little development. The tank, thesubmarine, the torpedo, the machine gun, even the rifle andthe hand grenade are still in use. And in spite of the end-less slaughters reported in the Press and on the telescreens,the desperate battles of earlier wars, in which hundreds ofthousands or even millions of men were often killed in afew weeks, have never been repeated.

None of the three super-states ever attempts any ma-

246 1984

noeuvre which involves the risk of serious defeat. Whenany large operation is undertaken, it is usually a surpriseattack against an ally. The strategy that all three powers arefollowing, or pretend to themselves that they are following,is the same. The plan is, by a combination of fighting, bar-gaining, and well-timed strokes of treachery, to acquire aring of bases completely encircling one or other of the ri-val states, and then to sign a pact of friendship with thatrival and remain on peaceful terms for so many years as tolull suspicion to sleep. During this time rockets loaded withatomic bombs can be assembled at all the strategic spots;finally they will all be fired simultaneously, with effects sodevastating as to make retaliation impossible. It will then betime to sign a pact of friendship with the remaining world-power, in preparation for another attack. This scheme, it ishardly necessary to say, is a mere daydream, impossible ofrealization. Moreover, no fighting ever occurs except in thedisputed areas round the Equator and the Pole: no invasionof enemy territory is ever undertaken. This explains the factthat in some places the frontiers between the superstatesare arbitrary. Eurasia, for example, could easily conquer theBritish Isles, which are geographically part of Europe, or onthe other hand it would be possible for Oceania to push itsfrontiers to the Rhine or even to the Vistula. But this wouldviolate the principle, followed on all sides though neverformulated, of cultural integrity. If Oceania were to con-quer the areas that used once to be known as France andGermany, it would be necessary either to exterminate theinhabitants, a task of great physical difficulty, or to assimi-

late a population of about a hundred million people, who,so far as technical development goes, are roughly on theOceanic level. The problem is the same for all three super-states. It is absolutely necessary to their structure that thereshould be no contact with foreigners, except, to a limitedextent, with war prisoners and coloured slaves. Even the of-ficial ally of the moment is always regarded with the darkestsuspicion. War prisoners apart, the average citizen of Ocea-nia never sets eyes on a citizen of either Eurasia or Eastasia,and he is forbidden the knowledge of foreign languages. Ifhe were allowed contact with foreigners he would discoverthat they are creatures similar to himself and that most ofwhat he has been told about them is lies. The sealed worldin which he lives would be broken, and the fear, hatred,and self-righteousness on which his morale depends mightevaporate. It is therefore realized on all sides that howeveroften Persia, or Egypt, or Java, or Ceylon may change hands,the main frontiers must never be crossed by anything ex-cept bombs.

Under this lies a fact never mentioned aloud, but tacitlyunderstood and acted upon: namely, that the conditions oflife in all three super-states are very much the same. In Oce-ania the prevailing philosophy is called Ingsoc, in Eurasiait is called Neo-Bolshevism, and in Eastasia it is called bya Chinese name usually translated as Death-Worship, butperhaps better rendered as Obliteration of the Self. The citi-zen of Oceania is not allowed to know anything of the tenetsof the other two philosophies, but he is taught to execratethem as barbarous outrages upon morality and common

sense. Actually the three philosophies are barely distin-guishable, and the social systems which they support arenot distinguishable at all. Everywhere there is the same py-ramidal structure, the same worship of semi-divine leader,the same economy existing by and for continuous warfare.It follows that the three super-states not only cannot con-quer one another, but would gain no advantage by doingso. On the contrary, so long as they remain in conflict theyprop one another up, like three sheaves of corn. And, asusual, the ruling groups of all three powers are simultane-ously aware and unaware of what they are doing. Their livesare dedicated to world conquest, but they also know that itis necessary that the war should continue everlastingly andwithout victory. Meanwhile the fact that there IS no dangerof conquest makes possible the denial of reality which is thespecial feature of Ingsoc and its rival systems of thought.Here it is necessary to repeat what has been said earlier, thatby becoming continuous war has fundamentally changedits character.

In past ages, a war, almost by definition, was somethingthat sooner or later came to an end, usually in unmistak-able victory or defeat. In the past, also, war was one of themain instruments by which human societies were kept intouch with physical reality. All rulers in all ages have triedto impose a false view of the world upon their followers, butthey could not afford to encourage any illusion that tendedto impair military efficiency So long as defeat meant theloss of independence, or some other result generally heldto be undesirable, the precautions against defeat had to be

serious. Physical facts could not be ignored. In philosophy,or religion, or ethics, or politics, two and two might makefive, but when one was designing a gun or an aeroplane theyhad to make four. Inefficient nations were always conqueredsooner or later, and the struggle for efficiency was inimi-cal to illusions. Moreover, to be efficient it was necessary tobe able to learn from the past, which meant having a fairlyaccurate idea of what had happened in the past. Newspa-pers and history books were, of course, always coloured andbiased, but falsification of the kind that is practised todaywould have been impossible. War was a sure safeguard ofsanity, and so far as the ruling classes were concerned it wasprobably the most important of all safeguards. While warscould be won or lost, no ruling class could be completely ir-responsible.

But when war becomes literally continuous, it also ceasesto be dangerous. When war is continuous there is no suchthing as military necessity. Technical progress can ceaseand the most palpable facts can be denied or disregarded.As we have seen, researches that could be called scientificare still carried out for the purposes of war, but they are es-sentially a kind of daydreaming, and their failure to showresults is not important. Efficiency, even military efficiency,is no longer needed. Nothing is efficient in Oceania exceptthe Thought Police. Since each of the three super-states isunconquerable, each is in effect a separate universe withinwhich almost any perversion of thought can be safely prac-tised. Reality only exerts its pressure through the needs ofeveryday life—the need to eat and drink, to get shelter and

1984

clothing, to avoid swallowing poison or stepping out of top -storey windows, and the like. Between life and death, andbetween physical pleasure and physical pain, there is stilla distinction, but that is all. Cut off from contact with theouter world, and with the past, the citizen of Oceania islike a man in interstellar space, who has no way of know-ing which direction is up and which is down. The rulers ofsuch a state are absolute, as the Pharaohs or the Caesarscould not be. They are obliged to prevent their followersfrom starving to death in numbers large enough to be in-convenient, and they are obliged to remain at the samelow level of military technique as their rivals; but once thatminimum is achieved, they can twist reality into whatevershape they choose.

The war, therefore, if we judge it by the standards of pre-vious wars, is merely an imposture. It is like the battlesbetween certain ruminant animals whose horns are set atsuch an angle that they are incapable of hurting one anoth-er. But though it is unreal it is not meaningless. It eats upthe surplus of consumable goods, and it helps to preservethe special mental atmosphere that a hierarchical societyneeds. War, it will be seen, is now a purely internal affair.In the past, the ruling groups of all countries, althoughthey might recognize their common interest and thereforelimit the destructiveness of war, did fight against one an-other, and the victor always plundered the vanquished. Inour own day they are not fighting against one another atall. The war is waged by each ruling group against its ownsubjects, and the object of the war is not to make or prevent

conquests of territory, but to keep the structure of societyintact. The very word 'war', therefore, has become mislead-ing. It would probably be accurate to say that by becomingcontinuous war has ceased to exist. The peculiar pressurethat it exerted on human beings between the Neolithic Ageand the early twentieth century has disappeared and beenreplaced by something quite different. The effect would bemuch the same if the three super-states, instead of fightingone another, should agree to live in perpetual peace, eachinviolate within its own boundaries. For in that case eachwould still be a self-contained universe, freed for ever fromthe sobering influence of external danger. A peace that wastruly permanent would be the same as a permanent war.This—although the vast majority of Party members under-stand it only in a shallower sense—is the inner meaning ofthe Party slogan: WAR IS PEACE.

Winston stopped reading for a moment. Somewhere inremote distance a rocket bomb thundered. The blissful feel-ing of being alone with the forbidden book, in a room withno telescreen, had not worn off. Solitude and safety werephysical sensations, mixed up somehow with the tirednessof his body, the softness of the chair, the touch of the faintbreeze from the window that played upon his cheek. Thebook fascinated him, or more exactly it reassured him. Ina sense it told him nothing that was new, but that was partof the attraction. It said what he would have said, if it hadbeen possible for him to set his scattered thoughts in or-der. It was the product of a mind similar to his own, butenormously more powerful, more systematic, less fear-rid-

den. The best books, he perceived, are those that tell youwhat you know already. He had just turned back to ChapterI when he heard Julia's footstep on the stair and started outof his chair to meet her. She dumped her brown tool-bag onthe floor and flung herself into his arms. It was more than aweek since they had seen one another.

'I've got THE BOOK,' he said as they disentangled them-selves.

'Oh, you've got it? Good,' she said without much interest,and almost immediately knelt down beside the oil stove tomake the coffee.

They did not return to the subject until they had beenin bed for half an hour. The evening was just cool enoughto make it worth while to pull up the counterpane. Frombelow came the familiar sound of singing and the scrapeof boots on the flagstones. The brawny red-armed womanwhom Winston had seen there on his first visit was almost afixture in the yard. There seemed to be no hour of daylightwhen she was not marching to and fro between the washtuband the line, alternately gagging herself with clothes pegsand breaking forth into lusty song. Julia had settled downon her side and seemed to be already on the point of fallingasleep. He reached out for the book, which was lying on thefloor, and sat up against the bedhead.

'We must read it,' he said. 'You too. All members of theBrotherhood have to read it.'

'You read it,' she said with her eyes shut. 'Read it aloud.That's the best way. Then you can explain it to me as you

The clock's hands said six, meaning eighteen. They hadthree or four hours ahead of them. He propped the bookagainst his knees and began reading:

Chapter I Ignorance is Strength

Throughout recorded time, and probably since the endof the Neolithic Age, there have been three kinds of peoplein the world, the High, the Middle, and the Low. They havebeen subdivided in many ways, they have borne count-less different names, and their relative numbers, as well astheir attitude towards one another, have varied from age toage: but the essential structure of society has never altered.Even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocablechanges, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, justas a gyroscope will always return to equilibnum, howeverfar it is pushed one way or the other

'Julia, are you awake?' said Winston.

'Yes, my love, I'm listening. Go on. It's marvellous.'

He continued reading:

The aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcil-able. The aim of the High is to remain where they are. Theaim of the Middle is to change places with the High. Theaim of the Low, when they have an aim—for it is an abidingcharacteristic of the Low that they are too much crushedby drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious ofanything outside their daily lives—is to abolish all distinc-tions and create a society in which all men shall be equal.Thus throughout history a struggle which is the same in itsmain outlines recurs over and over again. For long periodsthe High seem to be securely in power, but sooner or later

1984

there always comes a moment when they lose either theirbelief in themselves or their capacity to govern efficientlyor both. They are then overthrown by the Middle, who en-list the Low on their side by pretending to them that theyare fighting for liberty and justice. As soon as they havereached their objective, the Middle thrust the Low backinto their old position of servitude, and themselves becomethe High. Presently a new Middle group splits off from oneof the other groups, or from both of them, and the strugglebegins over again. Of the three groups, only the Low arenever even temporarily successful in achieving their aims.It would be an exaggeration to say that throughout historythere has been no progress of a material kind. Even today,in a period of decline, the average human being is physical-ly better off than he was a few centuries ago. But no advancein wealth, no softening of manners, no reform or revolu-tion has ever brought human equality a millimetre nearer.From the point of view of the Low, no historic change hasever meant much more than a change in the name of theirmasters.

By the late nineteenth century the recurrence of this pat-tern had become obvious to many observers. There thenrose schools of thinkers who interpreted history as a cy-clical process and claimed to show that inequality was theunalterable law of human life. This doctrine, of course, hadalways had its adherents, but in the manner in which it wasnow put forward there was a significant change. In the pastthe need for a hierarchical form of society had been the doc-trine specifically of the High. It had been preached by kings

and aristocrats and by the priests, lawyers, and the like whowere parasitical upon them, and it had generally been soft-ened by promises of compensation in an imaginary worldbeyond the grave. The Middle, so long as it was strugglingfor power, had always made use of such terms as freedom,justice, and fraternity Now, however, the concept of hu-man brotherhood began to be assailed by people who werenot yet in positions of command, but merely hoped to be sobefore long. In the past the Middle had made revolutionsunder the banner of equality, and then had established afresh tyranny as soon as the old one was overthrown. Thenew Middle groups in effect proclaimed their tyranny be-forehand. Socialism, a theory which appeared in the earlynineteenth century and was the last link in a chain ofthought stretching back to the slave rebellions of antiquity,was still deeply infected by the Utopianism of past ages. Butin each variant of Socialism that appeared from about 1900onwards the aim of establishing liberty and equality wasmore and more openly abandoned. The new movementswhich appeared in the middle years of the century, Ingsocin Oceania, Neo-Bolshevism in Eurasia, Death-Worship, asit is commonly called, in Eastasia, had the conscious aimof perpetuating UNfreedom and INequality These newmovements, of course, grew out of the old ones and tendedto keep their names and pay lip-service to their ideology.But the purpose of all of them was to arrest progress andfreeze history at a chosen moment. The familiar pendulumswing was to happen once more, and then stop. As usual,the High were to be turned out by the Middle, who would

256 1984

then become the High; but this time, by conscious strategy,the High would be able to maintain their position perma-nently.

The new doctrines arose partly because of the accu-mulation of historical knowledge, and the growth of thehistorical sense, which had hardly existed before the nine-teenth century. The cyclical movement of history was nowintelligible, or appeared to be so; and if it was intelligible,then it was alterable. But the principal, underlying causewas that, as early as the beginning of the twentieth century,human equality had become technically possible. It was stilltrue that men were not equal in their native talents and thatfunctions had to be specialized in ways that favoured someindividuals against others; but there was no longer any realneed for class distinctions or for large differences of wealth.In earlier ages, class distinctions had been not only inevi-table but desirable. Inequality was the price of civilization.With the development of machine production, however, thecase was altered. Even if it was still necessary for humanbeings to do different kinds of work, it was no longer neces-sary for them to live at different social or economic levels.Therefore, from the point of view of the new groups whowere on the point of seizing power, human equality was nolonger an ideal to be striven after, but a danger to be avert-ed. In more primitive ages, when a just and peaceful societywas in fact not possible, it had been fairly easy to believe it.The idea of an earthly paradise in which men should livetogether in a state of brotherhood, without laws and with-out brute labour, had haunted the human imagination for

thousands of years. And this vision had had a certain holdeven on the groups who actually profited by each histori-cal change. The heirs of the French, English, and Americanrevolutions had partly believed in their own phrases aboutthe rights of man, freedom of speech, equality before thelaw, and the like, and have even allowed their conduct tobe influenced by them to some extent. But by the fourthdecade of the twentieth century all the main currents ofpolitical thought were authoritarian. The earthly paradisehad been discredited at exactly the moment when it becamerealizable. Every new political theory, by whatever name itcalled itself, led back to hierarchy and regimentation. Andin the general hardening of outlook that set in round about1930, practices which had been long abandoned, in somecases for hundreds of years—imprisonment without trial,the use of war prisoners as slaves, public executions, tortureto extract confessions, the use of hostages, and the depor-tation of whole populations—not only became commonagain, but were tolerated and even defended by people whoconsidered themselves enlightened and progressive.

It was only after a decade of national wars, civil wars,revolutions, and counter-revolutions in all parts of theworld that Ingsoc and its rivals emerged as fully worked-out political theories. But they had been foreshadowed bythe various systems, generally called totalitarian, whichhad appeared earlier in the century, and the main outlinesof the world which would emerge from the prevailing chaoshad long been obvious. What kind of people would controlthis world had been equally obvious. The new aristocracy

258 1984

was made up for the most part of bureaucrats, scientists,technicians, trade-union organizers, publicity experts, so-ciologists, teachers, journalists, and professional politicians.These people, whose origins lay in the salaried middle classand the upper grades of the working class, had been shapedand brought together by the barren world of monopoly in-dustry and centralized government. As compared withtheir opposite numbers in past ages, they were less avari-cious, less tempted by luxury, hungrier for pure power, and,above all, more conscious of what they were doing andmore intent on crushing opposition. This last difference wascardinal. By comparison with that existing today, all thetyrannies of the past were half-hearted and inefficient. Theruling groups were always infected to some extent by lib-eral ideas, and were content to leave loose ends everywhere,to regard only the overt act and to be uninterested in whattheir subjects were thinking. Even the Catholic Church ofthe Middle Ages was tolerant by modern standards. Part ofthe reason for this was that in the past no government hadthe power to keep its citizens under constant surveillance.The invention of print, however, made it easier to manipu-late public opinion, and the film and the radio carried theprocess further. With the development of television, andthe technical advance which made it possible to receive andtransmit simultaneously on the same instrument, privatelife came to an end. Every citizen, or at least every citizenimportant enough to be worth watching, could be kept fortwenty-four hours a day under the eyes of the police and inthe sound of official propaganda, with all other channels

of communication closed. The possibility of enforcing notonly complete obedience to the will of the State, but com-plete uniformity of opinion on all subjects, now existed forthe first time.

After the revolutionary period of the fifties and sixties,society regrouped itself, as always, into High, Middle, andLow. But the new High group, unlike all its forerunners, didnot act upon instinct but knew what was needed to safeguardits position. It had long been realized that the only securebasis for oligarchy is collectivism. Wealth and privilege aremost easily defended when they are possessed jointly. Theso-called 'abolition of private property' which took place inthe middle years of the century meant, in effect, the con-centration of property in far fewer hands than before: butwith this difference, that the new owners were a group in-stead of a mass of individuals. Individually, no member ofthe Party owns anything, except petty personal belongings.Collectively, the Party owns everything in Oceania, be-cause it controls everything, and disposes of the productsas it thinks fit. In the years following the Revolution it wasable to step into this commanding position almost unop-posed, because the whole process was represented as an actof collectivization. It had always been assumed that if thecapitalist class were expropriated, Socialism must follow:and unquestionably the capitalists had been expropriated.Factories, mines, land, houses, transport—everything hadbeen taken away from them: and since these things wereno longer private property, it followed that they must bepublic property. Ingsoc, which grew out of the earlier So-

1984

cialist movement and inherited its phraseology, has in factcarried out the main item in the Socialist programme; withthe result, foreseen and intended beforehand, that econom-ic inequality has been made permanent.

But the problems of perpetuating a hierarchical soci-ety go deeper than this. There are only four ways in whicha ruling group can fall from power. Either it is conqueredfrom without, or it governs so inefficiently that the massesare stirred to revolt, or it allows a strong and discontentedMiddle group to come into being, or it loses its own self-confidence and willingness to govern. These causes do notoperate singly, and as a rule all four of them are present insome degree. A ruling class which could guard against allof them would remain in power permanently. Ultimatelythe determining factor is the mental attitude of the rulingclass itself.

After the middle of the present century, the first dan-ger had in reality disappeared. Each of the three powerswhich now divide the world is in fact unconquerable, andcould only become conquerable through slow demographicchanges which a government with wide powers can easi-ly avert. The second danger, also, is only a theoretical one.The masses never revolt of their own accord, and they neverrevolt merely because they are oppressed. Indeed, so longas they are not permitted to have standards of comparison,they never even become aware that they are oppressed. Therecurrent economic crises of past times were totally un-necessary and are not now permitted to happen, but otherand equally large dislocations can and do happen without

having political results, because there is no way in whichdiscontent can become articulate. As for the problem ofover-production, which has been latent in our society sincethe development of machine technique, it is solved by thedevice of continuous warfare (see Chapter III), which isalso useful in keying up public morale to the necessarypitch. From the point of view of our present rulers, there-fore, the only genuine dangers are the splitting-off of a newgroup of able, under-employed, power-hungry people, andthe growth of liberalism and scepticism in their own ranks.The problem, that is to say, is educational. It is a problemof continuously moulding the consciousness both of thedirecting group and of the larger executive group that liesimmediately below it. The consciousness of the massesneeds only to be influenced in a negative way.

Given this background, one could infer, if one did notknow it already, the general structure of Oceanic society. Atthe apex of the pyramid comes Big Brother. Big Brother is in-fallible and all-powerful. Every success, every achievement,every victory, every scientific discovery, all knowledge, allwisdom, all happiness, all virtue, are held to issue directlyfrom his leadership and inspiration. Nobody has ever seenBig Brother. He is a face on the hoardings, a voice on thetelescreen. We may be reasonably sure that he will never die,and there is already considerable uncertainty as to when hewas born. Big Brother is the guise in which the Party choos-es to exhibit itself to the world. His function is to act as afocusing point for love, fear, and reverence, emotions whichare more easily felt towards an individual than towards an

1984

organization. Below Big Brother comes the Inner Party. Itsnumbers limited to six millions, or something less than2 per cent of the population of Oceania. Below the InnerParty comes the Outer Party, which, if the Inner Party is de-scribed as the brain of the State, may be justly likened to thehands. Below that come the dumb masses whom we habitu-ally refer to as 'the proles', numbering perhaps 85 per cent ofthe population. In the terms of our earlier classification, theproles are the Low: for the slave population of the equatori-al lands who pass constantly from conqueror to conqueror,are not a permanent or necessary part of the structure.

In principle, membership of these three groups is not he-reditary. The child of Inner Party parents is in theory notborn into the Inner Party. Admission to either branch of theParty is by examination, taken at the age of sixteen. Nor isthere any racial discrimination, or any marked dominationof one province by another. Jews, Negroes, South Ameri-cans of pure Indian blood are to be found in the highestranks of the Party, and the administrators of any area arealways drawn from the inhabitants of that area. In no partof Oceania do the inhabitants have the feeling that they area colonial population ruled from a distant capital. Ocea-nia has no capital, and its titular head is a person whosewhereabouts nobody knows. Except that English is its chiefLINGUA FRANCA and Newspeak its official language, it isnot centralized in any way. Its rulers are not held togetherby blood-ties but by adherence to a common doctrine. Itis true that our society is stratified, and very rigidly strat-ified, on what at first sight appear to be hereditary lines.

There is far less to-and-fro movement between the differ-ent groups than happened under capitalism or even in thepre-industrial age. Between the two branches of the Partythere is a certain amount of interchange, but only so muchas will ensure that weaklings are excluded from the InnerParty and that ambitious members of the Outer Party aremade harmless by allowing them to rise. Proletarians, inpractice, are not allowed to graduate into the Party. Themost gifted among them, who might possibly become nu-clei of discontent, are simply marked down by the ThoughtPolice and eliminated. But this state of affairs is not neces-sarily permanent, nor is it a matter of principle. The Partyis not a class in the old sense of the word. It does not aimat transmitting power to its own children, as such; and ifthere were no other way of keeping the ablest people at thetop, it would be perfectly prepared to recruit an entire newgeneration from the ranks of the proletariat. In the crucialyears, the fact that the Party was not a hereditary body dida great deal to neutralize opposition. The older kind of So-cialist, who had been trained to fight against somethingcalled 'class privilege' assumed that what is not hereditarycannot be permanent. He did not see that the continuityof an oligarchy need not be physical, nor did he pause toreflect that hereditary aristocracies have always been short-lived, whereas adoptive organizations such as the CatholicChurch have sometimes lasted for hundreds or thousandsof years. The essence of oligarchical rule is not father-to-soninheritance, but the persistence of a certain world-view anda certain way of life, imposed by the dead upon the living. A

ruling group is a ruling group so long as it can nominate itssuccessors. The Party is not concerned with perpetuatingits blood but with perpetuating itself. WHO wields poweris not important, provided that the hierarchical structureremains always the same.

All the beliefs, habits, tastes, emotions, mental attitudesthat characterize our time are really designed to sustain themystique of the Party and prevent the true nature of pres-ent-day society from being perceived. Physical rebellion, orany preliminary move towards rebellion, is at present notpossible. From the proletarians nothing is to be feared. Leftto themselves, they will continue from generation to gener-ation and from century to century, working, breeding, anddying, not only without any impulse to rebel, but withoutthe power of grasping that the world could be other than itis. They could only become dangerous if the advance of in-dustrial technique made it necessary to educate them morehighly; but, since military and commercial rivalry are nolonger important, the level of popular education is actuallydeclining. What opinions the masses hold, or do not hold,is looked on as a matter of indifference. They can be grantedintellectual liberty because they have no intellect. In a Partymember, on the other hand, not even the smallest deviationof opinion on the most unimportant subject can be toler-ated.

A Party member lives from birth to death under the eyeof the Thought Police. Even when he is alone he can never besure that he is alone. Wherever he may be, asleep or awake,working or resting, in his bath or in bed, he can be inspected

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 265

without warning and without knowing that he is being in-spected. Nothing that he does is indifferent. His friendships,his relaxations, his behaviour towards his wife and children,the expression of his face when he is alone, the words hemutters in sleep, even the characteristic movements of hisbody, are all jealously scrutinized. Not only any actual mis-demeanour, but any eccentricity, however small, any changeof habits, any nervous mannerism that could possibly bethe symptom of an inner struggle, is certain to be detected.He has no freedom of choice in any direction whatever. Onthe other hand his actions are not regulated by law or by anyclearly formulated code of behaviour. In Oceania there isno law. Thoughts and actions which, when detected, meancertain death are not formally forbidden, and the endlesspurges, arrests, tortures, imprisonments, and vaporizationsare not inflicted as punishment for crimes which have ac-tually been committed, but are merely the wiping-out ofpersons who might perhaps commit a crime at some time inthe future. A Party member is required to have not only theright opinions, but the right instincts. Many of the beliefsand attitudes demanded of him are never plainly stated, andcould not be stated without laying bare the contradictionsinherent in Ingsoc. If he is a person naturally orthodox (inNewspeak a GOODTHINKER), he will in all circumstanc-es know, without taking thought, what is the true belief orthe desirable emotion. But in any case an elaborate men-tal training, undergone in childhood and grouping itselfround the Newspeak words CRIMESTOP, BLACKWHITE,and DOUBLETHINK, makes him unwilling and unable to

1984

think too deeply on any subject whatever.

A Party member is expected to have no private emotionsand no respites from enthusiasm. He is supposed to live in acontinuous frenzy of hatred of foreign enemies and internaltraitors, triumph over victories, and self-abasement beforethe power and wisdom of the Party. The discontents pro-duced by his bare, unsatisfying life are deliberately turnedoutwards and dissipated by such devices as the Two MinutesHate, and the speculations which might possibly induce asceptical or rebellious attitude are killed in advance by hisearly acquired inner discipline. The first and simplest stagein the discipline, which can be taught even to young chil-dren, is called, in Newspeak, CRIMESTOP CRIMESTOPmeans the faculty of stopping short, as though by instinct,at the threshold of any dangerous thought. It includes thepower of not grasping analogies, of failing to perceive logi-cal errors, of misunderstanding the simplest arguments ifthey are inimical to Ingsoc, and of being bored or repelledby any train of thought which is capable of leading in aheretical direction. CRIMESTOP, in short, means protec-tive stupidity. But stupidity is not enough. On the contrary,orthodoxy in the full sense demands a control over one'sown mental processes as complete as that of a contortion-ist over his body. Oceanic society rests ultimately on thebelief that Big Brother is omnipotent and that the Party isinfallible. But since in reality Big Brother is not omnipotentand the party is not infallible, there is need for an unwea-rying, moment-to-moment flexibility in the treatment offacts. The keyword here is BLACKWHITE. Like so many

Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 267

Newspeak words, this word has two mutually contradicto-ry meanings. Applied to an opponent, it means the habit ofimpudently claiming that black is white, in contradiction ofthe plain facts. Applied to a Party member, it means a loyalwillingness to say that black is white when Party disciplinedemands this. But it means also the ability to BELIEVE thatblack is white, and more, to KNOW that black is white, andto forget that one has ever believed the contrary. This de-mands a continuous alteration of the past, made possibleby the system of thought which really embraces all the rest,and which is known in Newspeak as DOUBLETHINK.

The alteration of the past is necessary for two reasons,one of which is subsidiary and, so to speak, precaution-ary. The subsidiary reason is that the Party member, likethe proletarian, tolerates present-day conditions partly be-cause he has no standards of comparison. He must be cutoff from the past, just as he must be cut off from foreigncountries, because it is necessary for him to believe thathe is better off than his ancestors and that the average lev-el of material comfort is constantly rising. But by far themore important reason for the readjustment of the past isthe need to safeguard the infallibility of the Party. It is notmerely that speeches, statistics, and records of every kindmust be constantly brought up to date in order to show thatthe predictions of the Party were in all cases right. It is alsothat no change in doctrine or in political alignment canever be admitted. For to change one's mind, or even one'spolicy, is a confession of weakness. If, for example, Eurasiaor Eastasia (whichever it may be) is the enemy today, then

1984

that country must always have been the enemy. And if thefacts say otherwise then the facts must be altered. Thus his-tory is continuously rewritten. This day-to-day falsificationof the past, carried out by the Ministry of Truth, is as neces-sary to the stability of the regime as the work of repressionand espionage carried out by the Ministry of Love.

The mutability of the past is the central tenet of Ingsoc.Past events, it is argued, have no objective existence, butsurvive only in written records and in human memories.The past is whatever the records and the memories agreeupon. And since the Party is in full control of all recordsand in equally full control of the minds of its members, itfollows that the past is whatever the Party chooses to makeit. It also follows that though the past is alterable, it neverhas been altered in any specific instance. For when it hasbeen recreated in whatever shape is needed at the moment,then this new version IS the past, and no different past canever have existed. This holds good even when, as often hap-pens, the same event has to be altered out of recognitionseveral times in the course of a year. At all times the Partyis in possession of absolute truth, and clearly the absolutecan never have been different from what it is now. It willbe seen that the control of the past depends above all onthe training of memory. To make sure that all written re-cords agree with the orthodoxy of the moment is merelya mechanical act. But it is also necessary to REMEMBERthat events happened in the desired manner. And if it isnecessary to rearrange one's memories or to tamper withwritten records, then it is necessary to FORGET that one

has done so. The trick of doing this can be learned like anyother mental technique. It is learned by the majority of Par-ty members, and certainly by all who are intelligent as wellas orthodox. In Oldspeak it is called, quite frankly, 'realitycontrol'. In Newspeak it is called DOUBLETHINK, thoughDOUBLETHINK comprises much else as well.

DOUBLETHINK means the power of holding twocontradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and ac-cepting both of them. The Party intellectual knows in whichdirection his memories must be altered; he therefore knowsthat he is playing tricks with reality; but by the exercise ofDOUBLETHINK he also satisfies himself that reality is notviolated. The process has to be conscious, or it would notbe carried out with sufficient precision, but it also has to beunconscious, or it would bring with it a feeling of falsity andhence of guilt. DOUBLETHINK lies at the very heart of In-gsoc, since the essential act of the Party is to use consciousdeception while retaining the firmness of purpose that goeswith complete honesty. To tell deliberate lies while genu-inely believing in them, to forget any fact that has becomeinconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again,to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed,to deny the existence of objective reality and all the whileto take account of the reality which one denies—all this isindispensably necessary. Even in using the word DOUBLE-THINK it is necessary to exercise DOUBLETHINK. Forby using the word one admits that one is tampering withreality; by a fresh act of DOUBLETHINK one erases thisknowledge; and so on indefinitely, with the lie always one

1984

leap ahead of the truth. Ultimately it is by means of DOU-BLETHINK that the Party has been able—and may, for allwe know, continue to be able for thousands of years—to ar-rest the course of history.

All past oligarchies have fallen from power either becausethey ossified or because they grew soft. Either they becamestupid and arrogant, failed to adjust themselves to chang-ing circumstances, and were overthrown; or they becameliberal and cowardly, made concessions when they shouldhave used force, and once again were overthrown. They fell,that is to say, either through consciousness or through un-consciousness. It is the achievement of the Party to haveproduced a system of thought in which both conditions canexist simultaneously. And upon no other intellectual basiscould the dominion of the Party be made permanent. If oneis to rule, and to continue ruling, one must be able to dis-locate the sense of reality. For the secret of rulership is tocombine a belief in one's own infallibility with the Power tolearn from past mistakes.

It need hardly be said that the subtlest practitioners ofDOUBLETHINK are those who invented DOUBLETHINKand know that it is a vast system of mental cheating. Inour society, those who have the best knowledge of what ishappening are also those who are furthest from seeing theworld as it is. In general, the greater the understanding, thegreater the delusion; the more intelligent, the less sane. Oneclear illustration of this is the fact that war hysteria increas-es in intensity as one rises in the social scale. Those whoseattitude towards the war is most nearly rational are the sub-

ject peoples of the disputed territories. To these people thewar is simply a continuous calamity which sweeps to andfro over their bodies like a tidal wave. Which side is win-ning is a matter of complete indifference to them. They areaware that a change of overlordship means simply that theywill be doing the same work as before for new masters whotreat them in the same manner as the old ones. The slightlymore favoured workers whom we call 'the proles' are onlyintermittently conscious of the war. When it is necessarythey can be prodded into frenzies of fear and hatred, butwhen left to themselves they are capable of forgetting forlong periods that the war is happening. It is in the ranks ofthe Party, and above all of the Inner Party, that the true warenthusiasm is found. World-conquest is believed in mostfirmly by those who know it to be impossible. This peculiarlinking-together of opposites—knowledge with ignorance,cynicism with fanaticism—is one of the chief distinguish-ing marks of Oceanic society. The official ideology aboundswith contradictions even when there is no practical reasonfor them. Thus, the Party rejects and vilifies every principlefor which the Socialist movement originally stood, and itchooses to do this in the name of Socialism. It preaches acontempt for the working class unexampled for centuriespast, and it dresses its members in a uniform which was atone time peculiar to manual workers and was adopted forthat reason. It systematically undermines the solidarity ofthe family, and it calls its leader by a name which is a directappeal to the sentiment of family loyalty. Even the names ofthe four Ministries by which we are governed exhibit a sort

1984

of impudence in their deliberate reversal of the facts. TheMinistry of Peace concerns itself with war, the Ministry ofTruth with lies, the Ministry of Love with torture and theMinistry of Plenty with starvation. These contradictionsare not accidental, nor do they result from ordinary hypoc-risy; they are deliberate exercises in DOUBLETHINK. Forit is only by reconciling contradictions that power can beretained indefinitely. In no other way could the ancient cy-cle be broken. If human equality is to be for ever averted—ifthe High, as we have called them, are to keep their placespermanently—then the prevailing mental condition mustbe controlled insanity.

But there is one question which until this moment wehave almost ignored. It is; WHY should human equality beaverted? Supposing that the mechanics of the process havebeen rightly described, what is the motive for this huge,accurately planned effort to freeze history at a particularmoment of time?

Here we reach the central secret. As we have seen, themystique of the Party, and above all of the Inner Party, de-pends upon DOUBLETHINK But deeper than this lies theoriginal motive, the never-questioned instinct that first ledto the seizure of power and brought DOUBLETHINK, theThought Police, continuous warfare, and all the other nec-essary paraphernalia into existence afterwards. This motivereally consists...

Winston became aware of silence, as one becomes awareof a new sound. It seemed to him that Julia had been verystill for some time past. She was lying on her side, na-

ked from the waist upwards, with her cheek pillowed onher hand and one dark lock tumbling across her eyes. Herbreast rose and fell slowly and regularly.

'Julia.'

No answer.

'Julia, are you awake?'

No answer. She was asleep. He shut the book, put it care-fully on the floor, lay down, and pulled the coverlet overboth of them.

He had still, he reflected, not learned the ultimate secret.He understood HOW; he did not understand WHY. Chap-ter I, like Chapter III, had not actually told him anythingthat he did not know, it had merely systematized the knowl-edge that he possessed already. But after reading it he knewbetter than before that he was not mad. Being in a minority,even a minority of one, did not make you mad. There wastruth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the trutheven against the whole world, you were not mad. A yellowbeam from the sinking sun slanted in through the windowand fell across the pillow. He shut his eyes. The sun on hisface and the girl's smooth body touching his own gave hima strong, sleepy, confident feeling. He was safe, everythingwas all right. He fell asleep murmuring 'Sanity is not sta-tistical,' with the feeling that this remark contained in it aprofound wisdom.

When he woke it was with the sensation of having sleptfor a long time, but a glance at the old-fashioned clock toldhim that it was only twenty-thirty He lay dozing for a while;

1984

then the usual deep-lunged singing struck up from the yardbelow:

'It was only an 'opeless fancy,

It passed like an Ipril dye,

But a look an a word an the dreams they stirred

They 'ave stolen my 'eart awye!'

The driveling song seemed to have kept its popularity.You still heard it all over the place. It had outlived the HateSong. Julia woke at the sound, stretched herself luxuriously,and got out of bed.

'I'm hungry' she said. 'Let's make some more coffee.Damn! The stove's gone out and the water's cold.' She pickedthe stove up and shook it. 'There's no oil in it.'

'We can get some from old Charrington, I expect.'

'The funny thing is I made sure it was full. I'm going toput my clothes on,' she added. 'It seems to have got colder.'

Winston also got up and dressed himself. The indefati-gable voice sang on:

"Ihey sye that time 'eals all things,

They sye you can always forget;

But the smiles an the tears acrorss the years

They twist my 'eart-strings yet!'

As he fastened the belt of his overalls he strolled acrossto the window. The sun must have gone down behind thehouses; it was not shining into the yard any longer. The flag-

stones were wet as though they had just been washed, andhe had the feeling that the sky had been washed too, so freshand pale was the blue between the chimney-pots. Tireless-ly the woman marched to and fro, corking and uncorkingherself, singing and falling silent, and pegging out more di-apers, and more and yet more. He wondered whether shetook in washing for a living or was merely the slave of twen-ty or thirty grandchildren. Julia had come across to his side;together they gazed down with a sort of fascination at thesturdy figure below. As he looked at the woman in her char-acteristic attitude, her thick arms reaching up for the line,her powerful mare-like buttocks protruded, it struck himfor the first time that she was beautiful. It had never beforeoccurred to him that the body of a woman of fifty, blown upto monstrous dimensions by childbearing, then hardened,roughened by work till it was coarse in the grain like anover-ripe turnip, could be beautiful. But it was so, and afterall, he thought, why not? The solid, contourless body, like ablock of granite, and the rasping red skin, bore the same re-lation to the body of a girl as the rose-hip to the rose. Whyshould the fruit be held inferior to the flower?

'She's beautiful,' he murmured.

'She's a metre across the hips, easily' said Julia.

'That is her style of beauty' said Winston.

He held Julia's supple waist easily encircled by his arm.From the hip to the knee her flank was against his. Out oftheir bodies no child would ever come. That was the onething they could never do. Only by word of mouth, frommind to mind, could they pass on the secret. The woman

276 1984

down there had no mind, she had only strong arms, a warmheart, and a fertile belly. He wondered how many childrenshe had given birth to. It might easily be fifteen. She hadhad her momentary flowering, a year, perhaps, of wild-rosebeauty and then she had suddenly swollen like a fertilizedfruit and grown hard and red and coarse, and then her lifehad been laundering, scrubbing, darning, cooking, sweep-ing, polishing, mending, scrubbing, laundering, first forchildren, then for grandchildren, over thirty unbrokenyears. At the end of it she was still singing. The mysticalreverence that he felt for her was somehow mixed up withthe aspect of the pale, cloudless sky, stretching away behindthe chimney-pots into interminable distance. It was curi-ous to think that the sky was the same for everybody, inEurasia or Eastasia as well as here. And the people underthe sky were also very much the same—everywhere, all overthe world, hundreds of thousands of millions of people justlike this, people ignorant of one another's existence, heldapart by walls of hatred and lies, and yet almost exactly thesame—people who had never learned to think but who werestoring up in their hearts and bellies and muscles the powerthat would one day overturn the world. If there was hope,it lay in the proles! Without having read to the end of THEBOOK, he knew that that must be Goldstein's final message.The future belonged to the proles. And could he be sure thatwhen their time came the world they constructed would notbe just as alien to him, Winston Smith, as the world of theParty? Yes, because at the least it would be a world of sanity.Where there is equality there can be sanity. Sooner or later

it would happen, strength would change into consciousness.The proles were immortal, you could not doubt it when youlooked at that valiant figure in the yard. In the end theirawakening would come. And until that happened, though itmight be a thousand years, they would stay alive against allthe odds, like birds, passing on from body to body the vital-ity which the Party did not share and could not kill.

'Do you remember,' he said, 'the thrush that sang to us,that first day, at the edge of the wood?'

'He wasn't singing to us,' said Julia. 'He was singing toplease himself. Not even that. He was just singing.'

The birds sang, the proles sang, the Party did not sing.All round the world, in London and New York, in Africaand Brazil, and in the mysterious, forbidden lands beyondthe frontiers, in the streets of Paris and Berlin, in the villag-es of the endless Russian plain, in the bazaars of China andJapan—everywhere stood the same solid unconquerablefigure, made monstrous by work and childbearing, toilingfrom birth to death and still singing. Out of those mightyloins a race of conscious beings must one day come. Youwere the dead, theirs was the future. But you could share inthat future if you kept alive the mind as they kept alive thebody, and passed on the secret doctrine that two plus twomake four.

'We are the dead,' he said.

'We are the dead,' echoed Julia dutifully.

'You are the dead,' said an iron voice behind them.

They sprang apart. Winston's entrails seemed to haveturned into ice. He could see the white all round the irises of

278 1984

Julia's eyes. Her face had turned a milky yellow. The smearof rouge that was still on each cheekbone stood out sharply,almost as though unconnected with the skin beneath.

'You are the dead,' repeated the iron voice.

'It was behind the picture,' breathed Julia.

'It was behind the picture,' said the voice. 'Remain exactlywhere you are. Make no movement until you are ordered.'

It was starting, it was starting at last! They could do noth-ing except stand gazing into one another's eyes. To run forlife, to get out of the house before it was too late—no suchthought occurred to them. Unthinkable to disobey the ironvoice from the wall. There was a snap as though a catch hadbeen turned back, and a crash of breaking glass. The picturehad fallen to the floor uncovering the telescreen behind it.

'Now they can see us,' said Julia.

'Now we can see you,' said the voice. 'Stand out in themiddle of the room. Stand back to back. Clasp your handsbehind your heads. Do not touch one another.'

They were not touching, but it seemed to him that hecould feel Julia's body shaking. Or perhaps it was merelythe shaking of his own. He could just stop his teeth fromchattering, but his knees were beyond his control. Therewas a sound of trampling boots below, inside the house andoutside. The yard seemed to be full of men. Something wasbeing dragged across the stones. The woman's singing hadstopped abruptly. There was a long, rolling clang, as thoughthe washtub had been flung across the yard, and then a con-fusion of angry shouts which ended in a yell of pain.

"The house is surrounded,' said Winston.

"The house is surrounded,' said the voice.

He heard Julia snap her teeth together. 'I suppose we mayas well say good-bye,' she said.

'You may as well say good-bye,' said the voice. And thenanother quite different voice, a thin, cultivated voice whichWinston had the impression of having heard before, struckin; 'And by the way, while we are on the subject, 'Here comesa candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to chopoff your head'!'

Something crashed on to the bed behind Winston's back.The head of a ladder had been thrust through the windowand had burst in the frame. Someone was climbing throughthe window. There was a stampede of boots up the stairs.The room was full of solid men in black uniforms, with iron-shod boots on their feet and truncheons in their hands.

Winston was not trembling any longer. Even his eyes hebarely moved. One thing alone mattered; to keep still, tokeep still and not give them an excuse to hit you! A manwith a smooth prize-fighter's jowl in which the mouth wasonly a slit paused opposite him balancing his truncheonmeditatively between thumb and forefinger. Winston methis eyes. The feeling of nakedness, with one's hands behindone's head and one's face and body all exposed, was almostunbearable. The man protruded the tip of a white tongue,licked the place where his lips should have been, and thenpassed on. There was another crash. Someone had pickedup the glass paperweight from the table and smashed it topieces on the hearth-stone.

The fragment of coral, a tiny crinkle of pink like a sug-

1984

ar rosebud from a cake, rolled across the mat. How small,thought Winston, how small it always was! There was a gaspand a thump behind him, and he received a violent kick onthe ankle which nearly flung him off his balance. One of themen had smashed his fist into Julia's solar plexus, doublingher up like a pocket ruler. She was thrashing about on thefloor, fighting for breath. Winston dared not turn his headeven by a millimetre, but sometimes her livid, gasping facecame within the angle of his vision. Even in his terror it wasas though he could feel the pain in his own body, the deadlypain which nevertheless was less urgent than the struggle toget back her breath. He knew what it was like; the terrible,agonizing pain which was there all the while but could notbe suffered yet, because before all else it was necessary tobe able to breathe. Then two of the men hoisted her up byknees and shoulders, and carried her out of the room like asack. Winston had a glimpse of her face, upside down, yel-low and contorted, with the eyes shut, and still with a smearof rouge on either cheek; and that was the last he saw ofher.

He stood dead still. No one had hit him yet. Thoughtswhich came of their own accord but seemed totally uninter-esting began to flit through his mind. He wondered whetherthey had got Mr Charrington. He wondered what they haddone to the woman in the yard. He noticed that he bad-ly wanted to urinate, and felt a faint surprise, because hehad done so only two or three hours ago. He noticed thatthe clock on the mantelpiece said nine, meaning twenty-one. But the light seemed too strong. Would not the light

be fading at twenty-one hours on an August evening? Hewondered whether after all he and Julia had mistaken thetime—had slept the clock round and thought it was twen-ty-thirty when really it was nought eight-thirty on thefollowing morning. But he did not pursue the thought fur-ther. It was not interesting.

There ws another, lighter step in the passage. MrCharrington came into the room. The demeanour ofthe black-uniformed men suddenly became more sub-dued. Something had also changed in Mr Charrington'sappearance. His eye fell on the fragments of the glass pa-perweight.

'Pick up those pieces,' he said sharply.

A man stooped to obey. The cockney accent had disap-peared; Winston suddenly realized whose voice it was thathe had heard a few moments ago on the telescreen. Mr Char-rington was still wearing his old velvet jacket, but his hair,which had been almost white, had turned black. Also he wasnot wearing his spectacles. He gave Winston a single sharpglance, as though verifying his identity, and then paid nomore attention to him. He was still recognizable, but he wasnot the same person any longer. His body had straightened,and seemed to have grown bigger. His face had undergoneonly tiny changes that had nevertheless worked a completetransformation. The black eyebrows were less bushy, thewrinkles were gone, the whole lines of the face seemed tohave altered; even the nose seemed shorter. It was the alert,cold face of a man of about five-and-thirty It occurred toWinston that for the first time in his life he was looking,

He did not know where he was. Presumably he was inthe Ministry of Love, but there was no way of mak-ing certain. He was in a high- ceilinged windowless cell withwalls of glittering white porcelain. Concealed lamps flood-ed it with cold light, and there was a low, steady hummingsound which he supposed had something to do with theair supply. A bench, or shelf, just wide enough to sit on ranround the wall, broken only by the door and, at the end op-posite the door, a lavatory pan with no wooden seat. Therewere four telescreens, one in each wall.

There was a dull aching in his belly. It had been thereever since they had bundled him into the closed van anddriven him away. But he was also hungry, with a gnaw-ing, unwholesome kind of hunger. It might be twenty-fourhours since he had eaten, it might be thirty-six. He still didnot know, probably never would know, whether it had beenmorning or evening when they arrested him. Since he wasarrested he had not been fed.

He sat as still as he could on the narrow bench, with hishands crossed on his knee. He had already learned to sitstill. If you made unexpected movements they yelled at youfrom the telescreen. But the craving for food was growingupon him. What he longed for above all was a piece of bread.He had an idea that there were a few breadcrumbs in the

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 285

pocket of his overalls. It was even possible—he thought thisbecause from time to time something seemed to tickle hisleg—that there might be a sizeable bit of crust there. In theend the temptation to find out overcame his fear; he slippeda hand into his pocket.

'Smith!' yelled a voice from the telescreen. '6079 SmithW.! Hands out of pockets in the cells!'

He sat still again, his hands crossed on his knee. Be-fore being brought here he had been taken to another placewhich must have been an ordinary prison or a temporarylock-up used by the patrols. He did not know how long hehad been there; some hours at any rate; with no clocks andno daylight it was hard to gauge the time. It was a noisy, evil-smelling place. They had put him into a cell similar to theone he was now in, but filthily dirty and at all times crowdedby ten or fifteen people. The majority of them were commoncriminals, but there were a few political prisoners amongthem. He had sat silent against the wall, jostled by dirtybodies, too preoccupied by fear and the pain in his belly totake much interest in his surroundings, but still noticingthe astonishing difference in demeanour between the Partyprisoners and the others. The Party prisoners were alwayssilent and terrified, but the ordinary criminals seemed tocare nothing for anybody. They yelled insults at the guards,fought back fiercely when their belongings were impound-ed, wrote obscene words on the floor, ate smuggled foodwhich they produced from mysterious hiding-places in theirclothes, and even shouted down the telescreen when it triedto restore order. On the other hand some of them seemed

1984

to be on good terms with the guards, called them by nick-names, and tried to wheedle cigarettes through the spyholein the door. The guards, too, treated the common criminalswith a certain forbearance, even when they had to handlethem roughly. There was much talk about the forced-labourcamps to which most of the prisoners expected to be sent.It was 'all right' in the camps, he gathered, so long as youhad good contacts and knew the ropes. There was bribery,favouritism, and racketeering of every kind, there was ho-mosexuality and prostitution, there was even illicit alcoholdistilled from potatoes. The positions of trust were givenonly to the common criminals, especially the gangsters andthe murderers, who formed a sort of aristocracy. All thedirty jobs were done by the politicals.

There was a constant come-and-go of prisoners of everydescription: drug-peddlers, thieves, bandits, black-mar-keteers, drunks, prostitutes. Some of the drunks were soviolent that the other prisoners had to combine to sup-press them. An enormous wreck of a woman, aged aboutsixty, with great tumbling breasts and thick coils of whitehair which had come down in her struggles, was carried in,kicking and shouting, by four guards, who had hold of herone at each corner. They wrenched off the boots with whichshe had been trying to kick them, and dumped her downacross Winston's lap, almost breaking his thigh-bones. Thewoman hoisted herself upright and followed them out witha yell of 'F bastards!' Then, noticing that she was sit-ting on something uneven, she slid off Winston's knees onto the bench.

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 287

'Beg pardon, dearie,' she said. 'I wouldn't 'a sat on you,only the buggers put me there. They dono 'ow to treat a lady,do they?' She paused, patted her breast, and belched. 'Par-don,' she said, 'I ain't meself, quite.'

She leant forward and vomited copiously on the floor.

"Ihass better,' she said, leaning back with closed eyes.'Never keep it down, thass what I say. Get it up while it'sfresh on your stomach, like.'

She revived, turned to have another look at Winston andseemed immediately to take a fancy to him. She put a vastarm round his shoulder and drew him towards her, breath-ing beer and vomit into his face.

"Wass your name, dearie?' she said.

'Smith,' said Winston.

'Smith?' said the woman. "Thass funny. My name's Smithtoo. Why' she added sentimentally, T might be your moth-er!'

She might, thought Winston, be his mother. She wasabout the right age and physique, and it was probable thatpeople changed somewhat after twenty years in a forced-la-bour camp.

No one else had spoken to him. To a surprising extentthe ordinary criminals ignored the Party prisoners. "ThepolITS,' they called them, with a sort of uninterested con-tempt. The Party prisoners seemed terrified of speaking toanybody, and above all of speaking to one another. Onlyonce, when two Party members, both women, were pressedclose together on the bench, he overheard amid the din ofvoices a few hurriedly-whispered words; and in particular a

1984

reference to something called 'room one-oh-one', which hedid not understand.

It might be two or three hours ago that they had broughthim here. The dull pain in his belly never went away, butsometimes it grew better and sometimes worse, and histhoughts expanded or contracted accordingly. When itgrew worse he thought only of the pain itself, and of his de-sire for food. When it grew better, panic took hold of him.There were moments when he foresaw the things that wouldhappen to him with such actuality that his heart gallopedand his breath stopped. He felt the smash of truncheons onhis elbows and iron-shod boots on his shins; he saw himselfgrovelling on the floor, screaming for mercy through bro-ken teeth. He hardly thought of Julia. He could not fix hismind on her. He loved her and would not betray her; butthat was only a fact, known as he knew the rules of arith-metic. He felt no love for her, and he hardly even wonderedwhat was happening to her. He thought oftener of O'Brien,with a flickering hope. O'Brien might know that he hadbeen arrested. The Brotherhood, he had said, never tried tosave its members. But there was the razor blade; they wouldsend the razor blade if they could. There would be perhapsfive seconds before the guard could rush into the cell. Theblade would bite into him with a sort of burning coldness,and even the fingers that held it would be cut to the bone.Everything came back to his sick body, which shrank trem-bling from the smallest pain. He was not certain that hewould use the razor blade even if he got the chance. It wasmore natural to exist from moment to moment, accepting

another ten minutes' life even with the certainty that therewas torture at the end of it.

Sometimes he tried to calculate the number of porcelainbricks in the walls of the cell. It should have been easy, buthe always lost count at some point or another. More often hewondered where he was, and what time of day it was. At onemoment he felt certain that it was broad daylight outside,and at the next equally certain that it was pitch darkness. Inthis place, he knew instinctively, the lights would never beturned out. It was the place with no darkness: he saw nowwhy O'Brien had seemed to recognize the allusion. In theMinistry of Love there were no windows. His cell might beat the heart of the building or against its outer wall; it mightbe ten floors below ground, or thirty above it. He movedhimself mentally from place to place, and tried to deter-mine by the feeling of his body whether he was perchedhigh in the air or buried deep underground.

There was a sound of marching boots outside. The steeldoor opened with a clang. A young officer, a trim black-uni-formed figure who seemed to glitter all over with polishedleather, and whose pale, straight-featured face was like awax mask, stepped smartly through the doorway. He mo-tioned to the guards outside to bring in the prisoner theywere leading. The poet Ampleforth shambled into the cell.The door clanged shut again.

Ampleforth made one or two uncertain movements fromside to side, as though having some idea that there was an-other door to go out of, and then began to wander up anddown the cell. He had not yet noticed Winston's presence.

1984

His troubled eyes were gazing at the wall about a metreabove the level of Winston's head. He was shoeless; large,dirty toes were sticking out of the holes in his socks. Hewas also several days away from a shave. A scrubby beardcovered his face to the cheekbones, giving him an air ofruffianism that went oddly with his large weak frame andnervous movements.

Winston roused himself a little from his lethargy. Hemust speak to Ampleforth, and risk the yell from the tele-screen. It was even conceivable that Ampleforth was thebearer of the razor blade.

Ampleforth,' he said.

There was no yell from the telescreen. Ampleforthpaused, mildly startled. His eyes focused themselves slowlyon Winston.

Ah, Smith!' he said. 'You too!'

'What are you in for?'

'To tell you the truth—' He sat down awkwardly on thebench opposite Winston. 'There is only one offence, is therenot?' he said.

And have you committed it?'

Apparently I have.'

He put a hand to his forehead and pressed his temples fora moment, as though trying to remember something.

'These things happen,' he began vaguely. 'I have beenable to recall one instance—a possible instance. It was anindiscretion, undoubtedly. We were producing a definitiveedition of the poems of Kipling. I allowed the word 'God' toremain at the end of a line. I could not help it!' he added al-

most indignantly, raising his face to look at Winston. 'It wasimpossible to change the line. The rhyme was 'rod". Do yourealize that there are only twelve rhymes to 'rod' in the en-tire language? For days I had racked my brains. There WASno other rhyme.'

The expression on his face changed. The annoyancepassed out of it and for a moment he looked almost pleased.A sort of intellectual warmth, the joy of the pedant who hasfound out some useless fact, shone through the dirt andscrubby hair.

'Has it ever occurred to you,' he said, 'that the whole his-tory of English poetry has been determined by the fact thatthe English language lacks rhymes?'

No, that particular thought had never occurred to Win-ston. Nor, in the circumstances, did it strike him as veryimportant or interesting.

'Do you know what time of day it is?' he said.

Ampleforth looked startled again. 'I had hardly thoughtabout it. They arrested me—it could be two days ago—per-haps three.' His eyes flitted round the walls, as though hehalf expected to find a window somewhere. 'There is no dif-ference between night and day in this place. I do not seehow one can calculate the time.'

They talked desultorily for some minutes, then, withoutapparent reason, a yell from the telescreen bade them besilent. Winston sat quietly, his hands crossed. Ampleforth,too large to sit in comfort on the narrow bench, fidgetedfrom side to side, clasping his lank hands first round oneknee, then round the other. The telescreen barked at him to

keep still. Time passed. Twenty minutes, an hour—it wasdifficult to judge. Once more there was a sound of bootsoutside. Winston's entrails contracted. Soon, very soon,perhaps in five minutes, perhaps now, the tramp of bootswould mean that his own turn had come.

The door opened. The cold-faced young officer steppedinto the cell. With a brief movement of the hand he indi-cated Ampleforth.

'Room 101,' he said.

Ampleforth marched clumsily out between the guards,his face vaguely perturbed, but uncomprehending.

What seemed like a long time passed. The pain in Win-ston's belly had revived. His mind sagged round and roundon the same trick, like a ball falling again and again intothe same series of slots. He had only six thoughts. The painin his belly; a piece of bread; the blood and the screaming;O'Brien; Julia; the razor blade. There was another spasm inhis entrails, the heavy boots were approaching. As the dooropened, the wave of air that it created brought in a power-ful smell of cold sweat. Parsons walked into the cell. He waswearing khaki shorts and a sports-shirt.

This time Winston was startled into self-forgetfulness.

'YOU here!' he said.

Parsons gave Winston a glance in which there wasneither interest nor surprise, but only misery. He beganwalking jerkily up and down, evidently unable to keep still.Each time he straightened his pudgy knees it was apparentthat they were trembling. His eyes had a wide-open, staringlook, as though he could not prevent himself from gazing at

something in the middle distance.

'What are you in for?' said Winston.

'Thoughtcrime!' said Parsons, almost blubbering. Thetone of his voice implied at once a complete admission ofhis guilt and a sort of incredulous horror that such a wordcould be applied to himself. He paused opposite Winstonand began eagerly appealing to him: 'You don't think they'llshoot me, do you, old chap? They don't shoot you if youhaven't actually done anything—only thoughts, which youcan't help? I know they give you a fair hearing. Oh, I trustthem for that! They'll know my record, won't they? YOUknow what kind of chap I was. Not a bad chap in my way.Not brainy, of course, but keen. I tried to do my best for theParty, didn't I? I'll get off with five years, don't you think? Oreven ten years? A chap like me could make himself prettyuseful in a labour-camp. They wouldn't shoot me for goingoff the rails just once?'

'Are you guilty?' said Winston.

'Of course I'm guilty!' cried Parsons with a servile glanceat the telescreen. 'You don't think the Party would arrestan innocent man, do you?' His frog-like face grew calm-er, and even took on a slightly sanctimonious expression.'Thoughtcrime is a dreadful thing, old man,' he said senten-tiously 'It's insidious. It can get hold of you without youreven knowing it. Do you know how it got hold of me? In mysleep! Yes, that's a fact. There I was, working away, trying todo my bit—never knew I had any bad stuff in my mind at all.And then I started talking in my sleep. Do you know whatthey heard me saying?'

1984

He sank his voice, like someone who is obliged for medi-cal reasons to utter an obscenity.

"Down with Big Brother!' Yes, I said that! Said it overand over again, it seems. Between you and me, old man, I'mglad they got me before it went any further. Do you knowwhat I'm going to say to them when I go up before the tribu-nal? 'Thank you,' I'm going to say, 'thank you for saving mebefore it was too late."

'Who denounced you?' said Winston.

'It was my little daughter,' said Parsons with a sort ofdoleful pride. 'She listened at the keyhole. Heard what Iwas saying, and nipped off to the patrols the very next day.Pretty smart for a nipper of seven, eh? I don't bear her anygrudge for it. In fact I'm proud of her. It shows I brought herup in the right spirit, anyway'

He made a few more jerky movements up and down,several times, casting a longing glance at the lavatory pan.Then he suddenly ripped down his shorts.

'Excuse me, old man,' he said. T can't help it. It's the wait-ing.'

He plumped his large posterior into the lavatory pan.Winston covered his face with his hands.

'Smith!' yelled the voice from the telescreen. '6079 SmithW! Uncover your face. No faces covered in the cells.'

Winston uncovered his face. Parsons used the lavatory,loudly and abundantly. It then turned out that the plug wasdefective and the cell stank abominably for hours after-wards.

Parsons was removed. More prisoners came and went,

mysteriously. One, a woman, was consigned to 'Room 101',and, Winston noticed, seemed to shrivel and turn a differ-ent colour when she heard the words. A time came when, ifit had been morning when he was brought here, it would beafternoon; or if it had been afternoon, then it would be mid-night. There were six prisoners in the cell, men and women.All sat very still. Opposite Winston there sat a man with achinless, toothy face exactly like that of some large, harm-less rodent. His fat, mottled cheeks were so pouched at thebottom that it was difficult not to believe that he had littlestores of food tucked away there. His pale-grey eyes flittedtimorously from face to face and turned quickly away againwhen he caught anyone's eye.

The door opened, and another prisoner was brought inwhose appearance sent a momentary chill through Win-ston. He was a commonplace, mean-looking man whomight have been an engineer or technician of some kind.But what was startling was the emaciation of his face. Itwas like a skull. Because of its thinness the mouth and eyeslooked disproportionately large, and the eyes seemed filledwith a murderous, unappeasable hatred of somebody orsomething.

The man sat down on the bench at a little distance fromWinston. Winston did not look at him again, but the tor-mented, skull-like face was as vivid in his mind as thoughit had been straight in front of his eyes. Suddenly he real-ized what was the matter. The man was dying of starvation.The same thought seemed to occur almost simultaneouslyto everyone in the cell. There was a very faint stirring all

the way round the bench. The eyes of the chinless man keptflitting towards the skull-faced man, then turning guiltilyaway, then being dragged back by an irresistible attraction.Presently he began to fidget on his seat. At last he stood up,waddled clumsily across the cell, dug down into the pocketof his overalls, and, with an abashed air, held out a grimypiece of bread to the skull-faced man.

There was a furious, deafening roar from the telescreen.The chinless man jumped in his tracks. The skull-faced manhad quickly thrust his hands behind his back, as thoughdemonstrating to all the world that he refused the gift.

'Bumstead!' roared the voice. '2713 Bumstead J.! Let fallthat piece of bread!'

The chinless man dropped the piece of bread on thefloor.

'Remain standing where you are,' said the voice. 'Face thedoor. Make no movement.'

The chinless man obeyed. His large pouchy cheeks werequivering uncontrollably. The door clanged open. As theyoung officer entered and stepped aside, there emergedfrom behind him a short stumpy guard with enormousarms and shoulders. He took his stand opposite the chin-less man, and then, at a signal from the officer, let free afrightful blow, with all the weight of his body behind it, fullin the chinless man's mouth. The force of it seemed almostto knock him clear of the floor. His body was flung acrossthe cell and fetched up against the base of the lavatory seat.For a moment he lay as though stunned, with dark bloodoozing from his mouth and nose. A very faint whimper-

ing or squeaking, which seemed unconscious, came out ofhim. Then he rolled over and raised himself unsteadily onhands and knees. Amid a stream of blood and saliva, thetwo halves of a dental plate fell out of his mouth.

The prisoners sat very still, their hands crossed on theirknees. The chinless man climbed back into his place. Downone side of his face the flesh was darkening. His mouth hadswollen into a shapeless cherry-coloured mass with a blackhole in the middle of it.

From time to time a little blood dripped on to the breastof his overalls. His grey eyes still flitted from face to face,more guiltily than ever, as though he were trying to discov-er how much the others despised him for his humiliation.

The door opened. With a small gesture the officer indi-cated the skull-faced man.

'Room 101,' he said.

There was a gasp and a flurry at Winston's side. The manhad actually flung himself on his knees on the floor, withhis hand clasped together.

'Comrade! Officer!' he cried. 'You don't have to take me tothat place! Haven't I told you everything already? What elseis it you want to know? There's nothing I wouldn't confess,nothing! Just tell me what it is and I'll confess straight off.Write it down and I'll sign it—anything! Not room 101!'

'Room 101,' said the officer.

The man's face, already very pale, turned a colour Win-ston would not have believed possible. It was definitely,unmistakably, a shade of green.

'Do anything to me!' he yelled. 'You've been starving me

298 1984

for weeks. Finish it off and let me die. Shoot me. Hang me.Sentence me to twenty-five years. Is there somebody elseyou want me to give away? Just say who it is and I'll tell youanything you want. I don't care who it is or what you do tothem. I've got a wife and three children. The biggest of themisn't six years old. You can take the whole lot of them andcut their throats in front of my eyes, and I'll stand by andwatch it. But not Room 101!'

'Room 101,' said the officer.

The man looked frantically round at the other prisoners,as though with some idea that he could put another victimin his own place. His eyes settled on the smashed face of thechinless man. He flung out a lean arm.

'That's the one you ought to be taking, not me!' he shout-ed. 'You didn't hear what he was saying after they bashedhis face. Give me a chance and I'll tell you every word of it.HE'S the one that's against the Party, not me.' The guardsstepped forward. The man's voice rose to a shriek. 'Youdidn't hear him!' he repeated. 'Something went wrong withthe telescreen. HE'S the one you want. Take him, not me!'

The two sturdy guards had stooped to take him by thearms. But just at this moment he flung himself across thefloor of the cell and grabbed one of the iron legs that sup-ported the bench. He had set up a wordless howling, like ananimal. The guards took hold of him to wrench him loose,but he clung on with astonishing strength. For perhapstwenty seconds they were hauling at him. The prisoners satquiet, their hands crossed on their knees, looking straightin front of them. The howling stopped; the man had no

breath left for anything except hanging on. Then there wasa different kind of cry. A kick from a guard's boot had bro-ken the fingers of one of his hands. They dragged him tohis feet.

'Room 101,' said the officer.

The man was led out, walking unsteadily, with headsunken, nursing his crushed hand, all the fight had goneout of him.

A long time passed. If it had been midnight when theskull-faced man was taken away, it was morning: if morn-ing, it was afternoon. Winston was alone, and had beenalone for hours. The pain of sitting on the narrow benchwas such that often he got up and walked about, unreprovedby the telescreen. The piece of bread still lay where the chin-less man had dropped it. At the beginning it needed a hardeffort not to look at it, but presently hunger gave way tothirst. His mouth was sticky and evil-tasting. The hum-ming sound and the unvarying white light induced a sortof faintness, an empty feeling inside his head. He would getup because the ache in his bones was no longer bearable,and then would sit down again almost at once because hewas too dizzy to make sure of staying on his feet. Wheneverhis physical sensations were a little under control the ter-ror returned. Sometimes with a fading hope he thought ofO'Brien and the razor blade. It was thinkable that the razorblade might arrive concealed in his food, if he were everfed. More dimly he thought of Julia. Somewhere or othershe was suffering perhaps far worse than he. She might bescreaming with pain at this moment. He thought: 'If I could

1984

save Julia by doubling my own pain, would I do it? Yes, Iwould.' But that was merely an intellectual decision, takenbecause he knew that he ought to take it. He did not feel it.In this place you could not feel anything, except pain andforeknowledge of pain. Besides, was it possible, when youwere actually suffering it, to wish for any reason that yourown pain should increase? But that question was not an-swerable yet.

The boots were approaching again. The door opened.O'Brien came in.

Winston started to his feet. The shock of the sight haddriven all caution out of him. For the first time in manyyears he forgot the presence of the telescreen.

"They've got you too!' he cried.

'They got me a long time ago,' said O'Brien with a mild,almost regretful irony. He stepped aside. From behind himthere emerged a broad-chested guard with a long blacktruncheon in his hand.

'You know this, Winston,' said O'Brien. 'Don't deceiveyourself. You did know it—you have always known it.'

Yes, he saw now, he had always known it. But there was notime to think of that. All he had eyes for was the truncheonin the guard's hand. It might fall anywhere; on the crown,on the tip of the ear, on the upper arm, on the elbow

The elbow! He had slumped to his knees, almost para-lysed, clasping the stricken elbow with his other hand.Everything had exploded into yellow light. Inconceivable,inconceivable that one blow could cause such pain! Thelight cleared and he could see the other two looking down

at him. The guard was laughing at his contortions. Onequestion at any rate was answered. Never, for any reasonon earth, could you wish for an increase of pain. Of painyou could wish only one thing: that it should stop. Nothingin the world was so bad as physical pain. In the face of painthere are no heroes, no heroes, he thought over and over ashe writhed on the floor, clutching uselessly at his disabledleft arm.

1984

Chapter 2

He was lying on something that felt like a camp bed, ex-cept that it was higher off the ground and that he wasfixed down in some way so that he could not move. Lightthat seemed stronger than usual was falling on his face.O'Brien was standing at his side, looking down at him in-tently. At the other side of him stood a man in a white coat,holding a hypodermic syringe.

Even after his eyes were open he took in his surround-ings only gradually. He had the impression of swimming upinto this room from some quite different world, a sort of un-derwater world far beneath it. How long he had been downthere he did not know. Since the moment when they arrest-ed him he had not seen darkness or daylight. Besides, hismemories were not continuous. There had been times whenconsciousness, even the sort of consciousness that one hasin sleep, had stopped dead and started again after a blankinterval. But whether the intervals were of days or weeks oronly seconds, there was no way of knowing.

With that first blow on the elbow the nightmare hadstarted. Later he was to realize that all that then happenedwas merely a preliminary, a routine interrogation to whichnearly all prisoners were subjected. There was a long rangeof crimes—espionage, sabotage, and the like—to which ev-eryone had to confess as a matter of course. The confession

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 303

was a formality, though the torture was real. How manytimes he had been beaten, how long the beatings had con-tinued, he could not remember. Always there were five orsix men in black uniforms at him simultaneously. Some-times it was fists, sometimes it was truncheons, sometimesit was steel rods, sometimes it was boots. There were timeswhen he rolled about the floor, as shameless as an animal,writhing his body this way and that in an endless, hopelesseffort to dodge the kicks, and simply inviting more and yetmore kicks, in his ribs, in his belly, on his elbows, on hisshins, in his groin, in his testicles, on the bone at the baseof his spine. There were times when it went on and on un-til the cruel, wicked, unforgivable thing seemed to him notthat the guards continued to beat him but that he could notforce himself into losing consciousness. There were timeswhen his nerve so forsook him that he began shouting formercy even before the beating began, when the mere sightof a fist drawn back for a blow was enough to make himpour forth a confession of real and imaginary crimes. Therewere other times when he started out with the resolve ofconfessing nothing, when every word had to be forced outof him between gasps of pain, and there were times when hefeebly tried to compromise, when he said to himself: T willconfess, but not yet. I must hold out till the pain becomesunbearable. Three more kicks, two more kicks, and then Iwill tell them what they want.' Sometimes he was beaten tillhe could hardly stand, then flung like a sack of potatoes onto the stone floor of a cell, left to recuperate for a few hours,and then taken out and beaten again. There were also longer

1984

periods of recovery. He remembered them dimly, becausethey were spent chiefly in sleep or stupor. He remembereda cell with a plank bed, a sort of shelf sticking out from thewall, and a tin wash-basin, and meals of hot soup and breadand sometimes coffee. He remembered a surly barber arriv-ing to scrape his chin and crop his hair, and businesslike,unsympathetic men in white coats feeling his pulse, tappinghis reflexes, turning up his eyelids, running harsh fingersover him in search for broken bones, and shooting needlesinto his arm to make him sleep.

The beatings grew less frequent, and became mainly athreat, a horror to which he could be sent back at any mo-ment when his answers were unsatisfactory. His questionersnow were not ruffians in black uniforms but Party intellec-tuals, little rotund men with quick movements and flashingspectacles, who worked on him in relays over periods whichlasted—he thought, he could not be sure—ten or twelvehours at a stretch. These other questioners saw to it that hewas in constant slight pain, but it was not chiefly pain thatthey relied on. They slapped his face, wrung his ears, pulledhis hair, made him stand on one leg, refused him leave tourinate, shone glaring lights in his face until his eyes ranwith water; but the aim of this was simply to humiliate himand destroy his power of arguing and reasoning. Their realweapon was the merciless questioning that went on and on,hour after hour, tripping him up, laying traps for him, twist-ing everything that he said, convicting him at every step oflies and self-contradiction until he began weeping as muchfrom shame as from nervous fatigue. Sometimes he would

weep half a dozen times in a single session. Most of the timethey screamed abuse at him and threatened at every hesita-tion to deliver him over to the guards again; but sometimesthey would suddenly change their tune, call him comrade,appeal to him in the name of Ingsoc and Big Brother, andask him sorrowfully whether even now he had not enoughloyalty to the Party left to make him wish to undo the evilhe had done. When his nerves were in rags after hours ofquestioning, even this appeal could reduce him to snivel-ling tears. In the end the nagging voices broke him downmore completely than the boots and fists of the guards. Hebecame simply a mouth that uttered, a hand that signed,whatever was demanded of him. His sole concern was tofind out what they wanted him to confess, and then confessit quickly, before the bullying started anew. He confessedto the assassination of eminent Party members, the dis-tribution of seditious pamphlets, embezzlement of publicfunds, sale of military secrets, sabotage of every kind. Heconfessed that he had been a spy in the pay of the Easta-sian government as far back as 1968. He confessed that hewas a religious believer, an admirer of capitalism, and a sex-ual pervert. He confessed that he had murdered his wife,although he knew, and his questioners must have known,that his wife was still alive. He confessed that for years hehad been in personal touch with Goldstein and had beena member of an underground organization which had in-cluded almost every human being he had ever known. Itwas easier to confess everything and implicate everybody.Besides, in a sense it was all true. It was true that he had

306 1984

been the enemy of the Party, and in the eyes of the Partythere was no distinction between the thought and the deed.

There were also memories of another kind. They stoodout in his mind disconnectedly, like pictures with black-ness all round them.

He was in a cell which might have been either dark orlight, because he could see nothing except a pair of eyes.Near at hand some kind of instrument was ticking slow-ly and regularly. The eyes grew larger and more luminous.Suddenly he floated out of his seat, dived into the eyes, andwas swallowed up.

He was strapped into a chair surrounded by dials, underdazzling lights. A man in a white coat was reading the dials.There was a tramp of heavy boots outside. The door clangedopen. The waxed-faced officer marched in, followed by twoguards.

'Room 101,' said the officer.

The man in the white coat did not turn round. He did notlook at Winston either; he was looking only at the dials.

He was rolling down a mighty corridor, a kilometrewide, full of glorious, golden light, roaring with laughterand shouting out confessions at the top of his voice. He wasconfessing everything, even the things he had succeededin holding back under the torture. He was relating the en-tire history of his life to an audience who knew it already.With him were the guards, the other questioners, the menin white coats, O'Brien, Julia, Mr Charrington, all rollingdown the corridor together and shouting with laughter.Some dreadful thing which had lain embedded in the fu-

ture had somehow been skipped over and had not happened.Everything was all right, there was no more pain, the lastdetail of his life was laid bare, understood, forgiven.

He was starting up from the plank bed in the half-cer-tainty that he had heard O'Brien's voice. All through hisinterrogation, although he had never seen him, he had hadthe feeling that O'Brien was at his elbow, just out of sight. Itwas O'Brien who was directing everything. It was he whoset the guards on to Winston and who prevented them fromkilling him. It was he who decided when Winston shouldscream with pain, when he should have a respite, when heshould be fed, when he should sleep, when the drugs shouldbe pumped into his arm. It was he who asked the ques-tions and suggested the answers. He was the tormentor, hewas the protector, he was the inquisitor, he was the friend.And once—Winston could not remember whether it wasin drugged sleep, or in normal sleep, or even in a momentof wakefulness—a voice murmured in his ear: 'Don't wor-ry, Winston; you are in my keeping. For seven years I havewatched over you. Now the turning-point has come. I shallsave you, I shall make you perfect.' He was not sure whetherit was O'Brien's voice; but it was the same voice that hadsaid to him, 'We shall meet in the place where there is nodarkness,' in that other dream, seven years ago.

He did not remember any ending to his interrogation.There was a period of blackness and then the cell, or room,in which he now was had gradually materialized round him.He was almost flat on his back, and unable to move. Hisbody was held down at every essential point. Even the back

308 1984

of his head was gripped in some manner. O'Brien was look-ing down at him gravely and rather sadly. His face, seenfrom below, looked coarse and worn, with pouches underthe eyes and tired lines from nose to chin. He was olderthan Winston had thought him; he was perhaps forty-eightor fifty. Under his hand there was a dial with a lever on topand figures running round the face.

'I told you,' said O'Brien, 'that if we met again it wouldbe here.'

'Yes,' said Winston.

Without any warning except a slight movement ofO'Brien's hand, a wave of pain flooded his body. It was afrightening pain, because he could not see what was hap-pening, and he had the feeling that some mortal injury wasbeing done to him. He did not know whether the thing wasreally happening, or whether the effect was electrically pro-duced; but his body was being wrenched out of shape, thejoints were being slowly torn apart. Although the pain hadbrought the sweat out on his forehead, the worst of all wasthe fear that his backbone was about to snap. He set histeeth and breathed hard through his nose, trying to keepsilent as long as possible.

'You are afraid,' said O'Brien, watching his face, 'that inanother moment something is going to break. Your especialfear is that it will be your backbone. You have a vivid mentalpicture of the vertebrae snapping apart and the spinal fluiddripping out of them. That is what you are thinking, is itnot, Winston?'

Winston did not answer. O'Brien drew back the lever on

the dial. The wave of pain receded almost as quickly as ithad come.

'That was forty,' said O'Brien. 'You can see that the num-bers on this dial run up to a hundred. Will you pleaseremember, throughout our conversation, that I have it inmy power to inflict pain on you at any moment and to what-ever degree I choose? If you tell me any lies, or attempt toprevaricate in any way, or even fall below your usual levelof intelligence, you will cry out with pain, instantly. Do youunderstand that?'

'Yes,' said Winston.

O'Brien's manner became less severe. He resettled hisspectacles thoughtfully, and took a pace or two up anddown. When he spoke his voice was gentle and patient. Hehad the air of a doctor, a teacher, even a priest, anxious toexplain and persuade rather than to punish.

'I am taking trouble with you, Winston,' he said, 'becauseyou are worth trouble. You know perfectly well what is thematter with you. You have known it for years, though youhave fought against the knowledge. You are mentally de-ranged. You suffer from a defective memory. You are unableto remember real events and you persuade yourself that youremember other events which never happened. Fortunatelyit is curable. You have never cured yourself of it, becauseyou did not choose to. There was a small effort of the willthat you were not ready to make. Even now, I am well aware,you are clinging to your disease under the impression thatit is a virtue. Now we will take an example. At this moment,which power is Oceania at war with?'

1984

'When I was arrested, Oceania was at war with Eastasia.'

'With Eastasia. Good. And Oceania has always been atwar with Eastasia, has it not?'

Winston drew in his breath. He opened his mouth tospeak and then did not speak. He could not take his eyesaway from the dial.

"The truth, please, Winston. YOUR truth. Tell me whatyou think you remember.'

'I remember that until only a week before I was arrested,we were not at war with Eastasia at all. We were in alliancewith them. The war was against Eurasia. That had lasted forfour years. Before that '

O'Brien stopped him with a movement of the hand.

'Another example,' he said. 'Some years ago you had avery serious delusion indeed. You believed that three men,three one-time Party members named Jones, Aaronson,and Rutherford—men who were executed for treacheryand sabotage after making the fullest possible confession—were not guilty of the crimes they were charged with. Youbelieved that you had seen unmistakable documentary evi-dence proving that their confessions were false. There wasa certain photograph about which you had a hallucination.You believed that you had actually held it in your hands. Itwas a photograph something like this.'

An oblong slip of newspaper had appeared betweenO'Brien's fingers. For perhaps five seconds it was within theangle of Winston's vision. It was a photograph, and therewas no question of its identity. It was THE photograph. Itwas another copy of the photograph of Jones, Aaronson,

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 311

and Rutherford at the party function in New York, whichhe had chanced upon eleven years ago and promptly de-stroyed. For only an instant it was before his eyes, then itwas out of sight again. But he had seen it, unquestionably hehad seen it! He made a desperate, agonizing effort to wrenchthe top half of his body free. It was impossible to move somuch as a centimetre in any direction. For the moment hehad even forgotten the dial. All he wanted was to hold thephotograph in his fingers again, or at least to see it.

'It exists!' he cried.

'No,' said O'Brien.

He stepped across the room. There was a memory holein the opposite wall. O'Brien lifted the grating. Unseen, thefrail slip of paper was whirling away on the current of warmair; it was vanishing in a flash of flame. O'Brien turned awayfrom the wall.

'Ashes,' he said. 'Not even identifiable ashes. Dust. It doesnot exist. It never existed.'

'But it did exist! It does exist! It exists in memory. I re-member it. You remember it.'

'I do not remember it,' said O'Brien.

Winston's heart sank. That was doublethink. He had afeeling of deadly helplessness. If he could have been certainthat O'Brien was lying, it would not have seemed to matter.But it was perfectly possible that O'Brien had really forgot-ten the photograph. And if so, then already he would haveforgotten his denial of remembering it, and forgotten theact of forgetting. How could one be sure that it was simpletrickery? Perhaps that lunatic dislocation in the mind could

1984

really happen: that was the thought that defeated him.

O'Brien was looking down at him speculatively. Morethan ever he had the air of a teacher taking pains with awayward but promising child.

"There is a Party slogan dealing with the control of thepast,' he said. 'Repeat it, if you please.'

"Who controls the past controls the future: who controlsthe present controls the past," repeated Winston obedient-

"Who controls the present controls the past," saidO'Brien, nodding his head with slow approval. 'Is it youropinion, Winston, that the past has real existence?'

Again the feeling of helplessness descended upon Win-ston. His eyes flitted towards the dial. He not only did notknow whether 'yes' or 'no' was the answer that would savehim from pain; he did not even know which answer he be-lieved to be the true one.

O'Brien smiled faintly. 'You are no metaphysician, Win-ston,' he said. 'Until this moment you had never consideredwhat is meant by existence. I will put it more precisely. Doesthe past exist concretely, in space? Is there somewhere orother a place, a world of solid objects, where the past is stillhappening?'

'No.'

"Then where does the past exist, if at all?'

'In records. It is written down.'

'In records. And ?'

'In the mind. In human memories.'

'In memory. Very well, then. We, the Party, control all

records, and we control all memories. Then we control thepast, do we not?'

'But how can you stop people remembering things?' criedWinston again momentarily forgetting the dial. 'It is invol-untary. It is outside oneself. How can you control memory?You have not controlled mine!'

O'Brien's manner grew stern again. He laid his hand onthe dial.

'On the contrary' he said, 'YOU have not controlled it.That is what has brought you here. You are here becauseyou have failed in humility, in self-discipline. You wouldnot make the act of submission which is the price of san-ity You preferred to be a lunatic, a minority of one. Onlythe disciplined mind can see reality, Winston. You believethat reality is something objective, external, existing in itsown right. You also believe that the nature of reality is self-evident. When you delude yourself into thinking that yousee something, you assume that everyone else sees the samething as you. But I tell you, Winston, that reality is not ex-ternal. Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else.Not in the individual mind, which can make mistakes, andin any case soon perishes: only in the mind of the Party,which is collective and immortal. Whatever the Party holdsto be the truth, is truth. It is impossible to see reality exceptby looking through the eyes of the Party. That is the factthat you have got to relearn, Winston. It needs an act of self-destruction, an effort of the will. You must humble yourselfbefore you can become sane.'

He paused for a few moments, as though to allow what

he had been saying to sink in.

'Do you remember,' he went on, 'writing in your dia-ry, 'Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two makefour'?'

'Yes,' said Winston.

O'Brien held up his left hand, its back towards Winston,with the thumb hidden and the four fingers extended.

'How many fingers am I holding up, Winston?'

'Four.'

'And if the party says that it is not four but five—thenhow many?'

'Four.'

The word ended in a gasp of pain. The needle of the dialhad shot up to fifty-five. The sweat had sprung out all overWinston's body. The air tore into his lungs and issued againin deep groans which even by clenching his teeth he couldnot stop. O'Brien watched him, the four fingers still ex-tended. He drew back the lever. This time the pain was onlyslightly eased.

'How many fingers, Winston?'

'Four.'

The needle went up to sixty.

'How many fingers, Winston?'

'Four! Four! What else can I say? Four!'

The needle must have risen again, but he did not look atit. The heavy, stern face and the four fingers filled his vision.The fingers stood up before his eyes like pillars, enormous,blurry, and seeming to vibrate, but unmistakably four.

'How many fingers, Winston?'

'Four! Stop it, stop it! How can you go on? Four! Four!'

'How many fingers, Winston?'

'Five! Five! Five!'

'No, Winston, that is no use. You are lying. You still thinkthere are four. How many fingers, please?'

'Four! five! Four! Anything you like. Only stop it, stopthe pain!'

Abruptly he was sitting up with O'Brien's arm round hisshoulders. He had perhaps lost consciousness for a few sec-onds. The bonds that had held his body down were loosened.He felt very cold, he was shaking uncontrollably, his teethwere chattering, the tears were rolling down his cheeks. Fora moment he clung to O'Brien like a baby, curiously com-forted by the heavy arm round his shoulders. He had thefeeling that O'Brien was his protector, that the pain wassomething that came from outside, from some other source,and that it was O'Brien who would save him from it.

'You are a slow learner, Winston,' said O'Brien gently.

'How can I help it?' he blubbered. 'How can I help seeingwhat is in front of my eyes? Two and two are four.'

Sometimes, Winston. Sometimes they are five. Some-times they are three. Sometimes they are all of them at once.You must try harder. It is not easy to become sane.'

He laid Winston down on the bed. The grip of his limbstightened again, but the pain had ebbed away and thetrembling had stopped, leaving him merely weak and cold.O'Brien motioned with his head to the man in the whitecoat, who had stood immobile throughout the proceedings.The man in the white coat bent down and looked closely

into Winston's eyes, felt his pulse, laid an ear against hischest, tapped here and there, then he nodded to O'Brien.

'Again,' said O'Brien.

The pain flowed into Winston's body. The needle must beat seventy, seventy-five. He had shut his eyes this time. Heknew that the fingers were still there, and still four. All thatmattered was somehow to stay alive until the spasm wasover. He had ceased to notice whether he was crying out ornot. The pain lessened again. He opened his eyes. O'Brienhad drawn back the lever.

'How many fingers, Winston?'

'Four. I suppose there are four. I would see five if I could.I am trying to see five.'

'Which do you wish: to persuade me that you see five, orreally to see them?'

'Really to see them.'

Again,' said O'Brien.

Perhaps the needle was eighty—ninety. Winston couldnot intermittently remember why the pain was happening.Behind his screwed-up eyelids a forest of fingers seemed tobe moving in a sort of dance, weaving in and out, disap-pearing behind one another and reappearing again. He wastrying to count them, he could not remember why. He knewonly that it was impossible to count them, and that this wassomehow due to the mysterious identity between five andfour. The pain died down again. When he opened his eyesit was to find that he was still seeing the same thing. In-numerable fingers, like moving trees, were still streamingpast in either direction, crossing and recrossing. He shut

his eyes again.

'How many fingers am I holding up, Winston?'

'I don't know. I don't know. You will kill me if you do thatagain. Four, five, six—in all honesty I don't know.'

'Better,' said O'Brien.

A needle slid into Winston's arm. Almost in the same in-stant a blissful, healing warmth spread all through his body.The pain was already half-forgotten. He opened his eyesand looked up gratefully at O'Brien. At sight of the heavy,lined face, so ugly and so intelligent, his heart seemed toturn over. If he could have moved he would have stretchedout a hand and laid it on O'Brien's arm. He had never lovedhim so deeply as at this moment, and not merely becausehe had stopped the pain. The old feeling, that at bottom itdid not matter whether O'Brien was a friend or an enemy,had come back. O'Brien was a person who could be talkedto. Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to beunderstood. O'Brien had tortured him to the edge of luna-cy, and in a little while, it was certain, he would send himto his death. It made no difference. In some sense that wentdeeper than friendship, they were intimates: somewhere orother, although the actual words might never be spoken,there was a place where they could meet and talk. O'Brienwas looking down at him with an expression which suggest-ed that the same thought might be in his own mind. Whenhe spoke it was in an easy, conversational tone.

'Do you know where you are, Winston?' he said.

'I don't know. I can guess. In the Ministry of Love.'

'Do you know how long you have been here?'

318 1984

'I don't know. Days, weeks, months—I think it ismonths.'

'And why do you imagine that we bring people to thisplace?'

'To make them confess.'

'No, that is not the reason. Try again.'

'To punish them.'

'No!' exclaimed O'Brien. His voice had changed extraor-dinarily, and his face had suddenly become both stern andanimated. 'No! Not merely to extract your confession, not topunish you. Shall I tell you why we have brought you here?To cure you! To make you sane! Will you understand, Win-ston, that no one whom we bring to this place ever leavesour hands uncured? We are not interested in those stupidcrimes that you have committed. The Party is not interestedin the overt act: the thought is all we care about. We do notmerely destroy our enemies, we change them. Do you un-derstand what I mean by that?'

He was bending over Winston. His face looked enormousbecause of its nearness, and hideously ugly because it wasseen from below. Moreover it was filled with a sort of exal-tation, a lunatic intensity. Again Winston's heart shrank. Ifit had been possible he would have cowered deeper into thebed. He felt certain that O'Brien was about to twist the dialout of sheer wantonness. At this moment, however, O'Brienturned away. He took a pace or two up and down. Then hecontinued less vehemently:

'The first thing for you to understand is that in this placethere are no martyrdoms. You have read of the religious

persecutions of the past. In the Middle Ages there was theInquisition. It was a failure. It set out to eradicate heresy, andended by perpetuating it. For every heretic it burned at thestake, thousands of others rose up. Why was that? Becausethe Inquisition killed its enemies in the open, and killedthem while they were still unrepentant: in fact, it killedthem because they were unrepentant. Men were dying be-cause they would not abandon their true beliefs. Naturallyall the glory belonged to the victim and all the shame to theInquisitor who burned him. Later, in the twentieth century,there were the totalitarians, as they were called. There werethe German Nazis and the Russian Communists. The Rus-sians persecuted heresy more cruelly than the Inquisitionhad done. And they imagined that they had learned fromthe mistakes of the past; they knew, at any rate, that onemust not make martyrs. Before they exposed their victimsto public trial, they deliberately set themselves to destroytheir dignity. They wore them down by torture and solitudeuntil they were despicable, cringing wretches, confessingwhatever was put into their mouths, covering themselveswith abuse, accusing and sheltering behind one another,whimpering for mercy. And yet after only a few years thesame thing had happened over again. The dead men hadbecome martyrs and their degradation was forgotten. Onceagain, why was it? In the first place, because the confessionsthat they had made were obviously extorted and untrue. Wedo not make mistakes of that kind. All the confessions thatare uttered here are true. We make them true. And aboveall we do not allow the dead to rise up against us. You must

1984

stop imagining that posterity will vindicate you, Winston.Posterity will never hear of you. You will be lifted clean outfrom the stream of history. We shall turn you into gas andpour you into the stratosphere. Nothing will remain of you,not a name in a register, not a memory in a living brain. Youwill be annihilated in the past as well as in the future. Youwill never have existed.'

Then why bother to torture me? thought Winston, with amomentary bitterness. O'Brien checked his step as thoughWinston had uttered the thought aloud. His large ugly facecame nearer, with the eyes a little narrowed.

'You are thinking,' he said, 'that since we intend to de-stroy you utterly, so that nothing that you say or do canmake the smallest difference—in that case, why do we go tothe trouble of interrogating you first? That is what you werethinking, was it not?'

'Yes,' said Winston.

O'Brien smiled slightly. 'You are a flaw in the pattern,Winston. You are a stain that must be wiped out. Did I nottell you just now that we are different from the persecutorsof the past? We are not content with negative obedience, noreven with the most abject submission. When finally yousurrender to us, it must be of your own free will. We do notdestroy the heretic because he resists us: so long as he re-sists us we never destroy him. We convert him, we capturehis inner mind, we reshape him. We burn all evil and allillusion out of him; we bring him over to our side, not in ap-pearance, but genuinely, heart and soul. We make him oneof ourselves before we kill him. It is intolerable to us that

an erroneous thought should exist anywhere in the world,however secret and powerless it may be. Even in the instantof death we cannot permit any deviation. In the old days theheretic walked to the stake still a heretic, proclaiming hisheresy, exulting in it. Even the victim of the Russian purgescould carry rebellion locked up in his skull as he walkeddown the passage waiting for the bullet. But we make thebrain perfect before we blow it out. The command of the olddespotisms was "Thou shalt not". The command of the total-itarians was 'Thou shalt". Our command is 'THOU ART".No one whom we bring to this place ever stands out againstus. Everyone is washed clean. Even those three miserabletraitors in whose innocence you once believed—Jones, Aar-onson, and Rutherford—in the end we broke them down. Itook part in their interrogation myself. I saw them gradu-ally worn down, whimpering, grovelling, weeping—and inthe end it was not with pain or fear, only with penitence.By the time we had finished with them they were only theshells of men. There was nothing left in them except sor-row for what they had done, and love of Big Brother. It wastouching to see how they loved him. They begged to be shotquickly, so that they could die while their minds were stillclean.'

His voice had grown almost dreamy. The exaltation, thelunatic enthusiasm, was still in his face. He is not pretend-ing, thought Winston, he is not a hypocrite, he believesevery word he says. What most oppressed him was the con-sciousness of his own intellectual inferiority. He watchedthe heavy yet graceful form strolling to and fro, in and out

of the range of his vision. O'Brien was a being in all wayslarger than himself. There was no idea that he had ever had,or could have, that O'Brien had not long ago known, ex-amined, and rejected. His mind CONTAINED Winston'smind. But in that case how could it be true that O'Brien wasmad? It must be he, Winston, who was mad. O'Brien haltedand looked down at him. His voice had grown stern again.

'Do not imagine that you will save yourself, Winston,however completely you surrender to us. No one who hasonce gone astray is ever spared. And even if we chose to letyou live out the natural term of your life, still you wouldnever escape from us. What happens to you here is for ever.Understand that in advance. We shall crush you down tothe point from which there is no coming back. Things willhappen to you from which you could not recover, if youlived a thousand years. Never again will you be capable ofordinary human feeling. Everything will be dead insideyou. Never again will you be capable of love, or friendship,or joy of living, or laughter, or curiosity, or courage, or in-tegrity. You will be hollow. We shall squeeze you empty, andthen we shall fill you with ourselves.'

He paused and signed to the man in the white coat.Winston was aware of some heavy piece of apparatus beingpushed into place behind his head. O'Brien had sat downbeside the bed, so that his face was almost on a level withWinston's.

'Three thousand,' he said, speaking over Winston's headto the man in the white coat.

Two soft pads, which felt slightly moist, clamped them-

selves against Winston's temples. He quailed. There waspain coming, a new kind of pain. O'Brien laid a hand reas-suringly, almost kindly, on his.

"This time it will not hurt,' he said. 'Keep your eyes fixedon mine.'

At this moment there was a devastating explosion, or whatseemed like an explosion, though it was not certain whetherthere was any noise. There was undoubtedly a blinding flashof light. Winston was not hurt, only prostrated. Althoughhe had already been lying on his back when the thing hap-pened, he had a curious feeling that he had been knockedinto that position. A terrific painless blow had flattened himout. Also something had happened inside his head. As hiseyes regained their focus he remembered who he was, andwhere he was, and recognized the face that was gazing intohis own; but somewhere or other there was a large patchof emptiness, as though a piece had been taken out of hisbrain.

'It will not last,' said O'Brien. 'Look me in the eyes. Whatcountry is Oceania at war with?'

Winston thought. He knew what was meant by Oceaniaand that he himself was a citizen of Oceania. He also re-membered Eurasia and Eastasia; but who was at war withwhom he did not know. In fact he had not been aware thatthere was any war.

'I don't remember.'

'Oceania is at war with Eastasia. Do you remember thatnow?'

'Yes.'

1984

'Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia. Since thebeginning of your life, since the beginning of the Party,since the beginning of history, the war has continued with-out a break, always the same war. Do you remember that?'

'Yes.'

'Eleven years ago you created a legend about three menwho had been condemned to death for treachery. You pre-tended that you had seen a piece of paper which provedthem innocent. No such piece of paper ever existed. You in-vented it, and later you grew to believe in it. You remembernow the very moment at which you first invented it. Do youremember that?'

'Yes.'

'Just now I held up the fingers of my hand to you. You sawfive fingers. Do you remember that?'

'Yes.'

O'Brien held up the fingers of his left hand, with thethumb concealed.

'There are five fingers there. Do you see five fingers?'

'Yes.'

And he did see them, for a fleeting instant, before thescenery of his mind changed. He saw five fingers, and therewas no deformity. Then everything was normal again, andthe old fear, the hatred, and the bewilderment came crowd-ing back again. But there had been a moment—he did notknow how long, thirty seconds, perhaps—of luminous cer-tainty, when each new suggestion of O'Brien's had filled upa patch of emptiness and become absolute truth, and whentwo and two could have been three as easily as five, if that

were what was needed. It had faded but before O'Brien haddropped his hand; but though he could not recapture it, hecould remember it, as one remembers a vivid experience atsome period of one's life when one was in effect a differentperson.

'You see now,' said O'Brien, 'that it is at any rate possi-ble.'

'Yes,' said Winston.

O'Brien stood up with a satisfied air. Over to his leftWinston saw the man in the white coat break an ampouleand draw back the plunger of a syringe. O'Brien turned toWinston with a smile. In almost the old manner he resettledhis spectacles on his nose.

'Do you remember writing in your diary' he said, 'thatit did not matter whether I was a friend or an enemy, sinceI was at least a person who understood you and could betalked to? You were right. I enjoy talking to you. Your mindappeals to me. It resembles my own mind except that youhappen to be insane. Before we bring the session to an endyou can ask me a few questions, if you choose.'

'Any question I like?'

'Anything.' He saw that Winston's eyes were upon thedial. 'It is switched off. What is your first question?'

'What have you done with Julia?' said Winston.

O'Brien smiled again. 'She betrayed you, Winston. Im-mediately—unreservedly. I have seldom seen anyone comeover to us so promptly. You would hardly recognize her ifyou saw her. All her rebelliousness, her deceit, her folly, herdirty-mindedness—everything has been burned out of her.

326 1984

It was a perfect conversion, a textbook case.'

'You tortured her?'

O'Brien left this unanswered. 'Next question,' he said.

'Does Big Brother exist?'

'Of course he exists. The Party exists. Big Brother is theembodiment of the Party.'

'Does he exist in the same way as I exist?'

'You do not exist,' said O'Brien.

Once again the sense of helplessness assailed him. Heknew, or he could imagine, the arguments which provedhis own nonexistence; but they were nonsense, they wereonly a play on words. Did not the statement, 'You do not ex-ist', contain a logical absurdity? But what use was it to sayso? His mind shrivelled as he thought of the unanswerable,mad arguments with which O'Brien would demolish him.

'I think I exist,' he said wearily. 'I am conscious of myown identity. I was born and I shall die. I have arms andlegs. I occupy a particular point in space. No other solidobject can occupy the same point simultaneously. In thatsense, does Big Brother exist?'

'It is of no importance. He exists.'

'Will Big Brother ever die?'

'Of course not. How could he die? Next question.'

'Does the Brotherhood exist?'

"That, Winston, you will never know. If we choose to setyou free when we have finished with you, and if you live tobe ninety years old, still you will never learn whether theanswer to that question is Yes or No. As long as you live itwill be an unsolved riddle in your mind.'

Winston lay silent. His breast rose and fell a little faster.He still had not asked the question that had come into hismind the first. He had got to ask it, and yet it was as thoughhis tongue would not utter it. There was a trace of amuse-ment in O'Brien's face. Even his spectacles seemed to wearan ironical gleam. He knows, thought Winston suddenly,he knows what I am going to ask! At the thought the wordsburst out of him:

'What is in Room 101?'

The expression on O'Brien's face did not change. He an-swered drily:

'You know what is in Room 101, Winston. Everyoneknows what is in Room 101.'

He raised a finger to the man in the white coat. Evidentlythe session was at an end. A needle jerked into Winston'sarm. He sank almost instantly into deep sleep.

1984

Chapter 3

^ There are three stages in your reintegration,' said O'Brien."There is learning, there is understanding, and there is ac-ceptance. It is time for you to enter upon the second stage.'

As always, Winston was lying flat on his back. But of latehis bonds were looser. They still held him to the bed, buthe could move his knees a little and could turn his headfrom side to side and raise his arms from the elbow. Thedial, also, had grown to be less of a terror. He could evade itspangs if he was quick-witted enough: it was chiefly when heshowed stupidity that O'Brien pulled the lever. Sometimesthey got through a whole session without use of the dial.He could not remember how many sessions there had been.The whole process seemed to stretch out over a long, indefi-nite time—weeks, possibly—and the intervals between thesessions might sometimes have been days, sometimes onlyan hour or two.

'As you lie there,' said O'Brien, 'you have often won-dered—you have even asked me—why the Ministry of Loveshould expend so much time and trouble on you. And whenyou were free you were puzzled by what was essentially thesame question. You could grasp the mechanics of the So-ciety you lived in, but not its underlying motives. Do youremember writing in your diary, 'I understand HOW: I donot understand WHY'? It was when you thought about

Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com

'why' that you doubted your own sanity. You have read THEBOOK, Goldstein's book, or parts of it, at least. Did it tellyou anything that you did not know already?'

'You have read it?' said Winston.

'I wrote it. That is to say, I collaborated in writing it. Nobook is produced individually, as you know.'

'Is it true, what it says?'

'As description, yes. The programme it sets forth is non-sense. The secret accumulation of knowledge—a gradualspread of enlightenment—ultimately a proletarian rebel-lion—the overthrow of the Party. You foresaw yourself thatthat was what it would say. It is all nonsense. The proletar-ians will never revolt, not in a thousand years or a million.They cannot. I do not have to tell you the reason: you knowit already. If you have ever cherished any dreams of violentinsurrection, you must abandon them. There is no way inwhich the Party can be overthrown. The rule of the Party isfor ever. Make that the starting-point of your thoughts.'

He came closer to the bed. 'For ever!' he repeated. 'Andnow let us get back to the question of'how' and 'why". Youunderstand well enough HOW the Party maintains itselfin power. Now tell me WHY we cling to power. What isour motive? Why should we want power? Go on, speak,' headded as Winston remained silent.

Nevertheless Winston did not speak for another mo-ment or two. A feeling of weariness had overwhelmed him.The faint, mad gleam of enthusiasm had come back intoO'Brien's face. He knew in advance what O'Brien would say.That the Party did not seek power for its own ends, but only

1984

for the good of the majority. That it sought power becausemen in the mass were frail, cowardly creatures who couldnot endure liberty or face the truth, and must be ruled overand systematically deceived by others who were strongerthan themselves. That the choice for mankind lay betweenfreedom and happiness, and that, for the great bulk of man-kind, happiness was better. That the party was the eternalguardian of the weak, a dedicated sect doing evil that goodmight come, sacrificing its own happiness to that of oth-ers. The terrible thing, thought Winston, the terrible thingwas that when O'Brien said this he would believe it. Youcould see it in his face. O'Brien knew everything. A thou-sand times better than Winston he knew what the worldwas really like, in what degradation the mass of human be-ings lived and by what lies and barbarities the Party keptthem there. He had understood it all, weighed it all, and itmade no difference: all was justified by the ultimate purpose.What can you do, thought Winston, against the lunatic whois more intelligent than yourself, who gives your argumentsa fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy?

'You are ruling over us for our own good,' he said feebly.You believe that human beings are not fit to govern them-selves, and therefore '

He started and almost cried out. A pang of pain had shotthrough his body. O'Brien had pushed the lever of the dialup to thirty-five.

'That was stupid, Winston, stupid!' he said. You shouldknow better than to say a thing like that.'

He pulled the lever back and continued:

'Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this.The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are notinterested in the good of others; we are interested solelyin power. Not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness:only power, pure power. What pure power means you willunderstand presently. We are different from all the oligar-chies of the past, in that we know what we are doing. Allthe others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cow-ards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the RussianCommunists came very close to us in their methods, butthey never had the courage to recognize their own motives.They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they hadseized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and thatjust round the corner there lay a paradise where human be-ings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We knowthat no one ever seizes power with the intention of relin-quishing it. Power is not a means, it is an end. One does notestablish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution;one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictator-ship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object oftorture is torture. The object of power is power. Now do youbegin to understand me?'

Winston was struck, as he had been struck before, by thetiredness of O'Brien's face. It was strong and fleshy and bru-tal, it was full of intelligence and a sort of controlled passionbefore which he felt himself helpless; but it was tired. Therewere pouches under the eyes, the skin sagged from thecheekbones. O'Brien leaned over him, deliberately bringingthe worn face nearer.

1984

'You are thinking,' he said, 'that my face is old and tired.You are thinking that I talk of power, and yet I am not evenable to prevent the decay of my own body. Can you not un-derstand, Winston, that the individual is only a cell? Theweariness of the cell is the vigour of the organism. Do youdie when you cut your fingernails?'

He turned away from the bed and began strolling up anddown again, one hand in his pocket.

'We are the priests of power,' he said. 'God is power. Butat present power is only a word so far as you are concerned.It is time for you to gather some idea of what power means.The first thing you must realize is that power is collective.The individual only has power in so far as he ceases to be anindividual. You know the Party slogan: 'Freedom is Slavery".Has it ever occurred to you that it is reversible? Slavery isfreedom. Alone—free—the human being is always defeated.It must be so, because every human being is doomed to die,which is the greatest of all failures. But if he can make com-plete, utter submission, if he can escape from his identity,if he can merge himself in the Party so that he IS the Party,then he is all-powerful and immortal. The second thing foryou to realize is that power is power over human beings.Over the body—but, above all, over the mind. Power overmatter—external reality, as you would call it—is not impor-tant. Already our control over matter is absolute.'

For a moment Winston ignored the dial. He made a vio-lent effort to raise himself into a sitting position, and merelysucceeded in wrenching his body painfully.

'But how can you control matter?' he burst out. 'You don't

even control the climate or the law of gravity. And there aredisease, pain, death '

O'Brien silenced him by a movement of his hand. 'Wecontrol matter because we control the mind. Reality is in-side the skull. You will learn by degrees, Winston. There isnothing that we could not do. Invisibility, levitation—any-thing. I could float off this floor like a soap bubble if I wishto. I do not wish to, because the Party does not wish it. Youmust get rid of those nineteenth-century ideas about thelaws of Nature. We make the laws of Nature.'

'But you do not! You are not even masters of this planet.What about Eurasia and Eastasia? You have not conqueredthem yet.'

'Unimportant. We shall conquer them when it suits us.And if we did not, what difference would it make? We canshut them out of existence. Oceania is the world.'

'But the world itself is only a speck of dust. And man istiny—helpless! How long has he been in existence? For mil-lions of years the earth was uninhabited.'

'Nonsense. The earth is as old as we are, no older. Howcould it be older? Nothing exists except through humanconsciousness.'

'But the rocks are full of the bones of extinct animals—mammoths and mastodons and enormous reptiles whichlived here long before man was ever heard of

'Have you ever seen those bones, Winston? Of course not.Nineteenth-century biologists invented them. Before manthere was nothing. After man, if he could come to an end,there would be nothing. Outside man there is nothing.'

1984

'But the whole universe is outside us. Look at the stars!Some of them are a million light-years away. They are out ofour reach for ever.'

'What are the stars?' said O'Brien indifferently. 'They arebits of fire a few kilometres away. We could reach them if wewanted to. Or we could blot them out. The earth is the cen-tre of the universe. The sun and the stars go round it.'

Winston made another convulsive movement. This timehe did not say anything. O'Brien continued as though an-swering a spoken objection:

'For certain purposes, of course, that is not true. Whenwe navigate the ocean, or when we predict an eclipse, we of-ten find it convenient to assume that the earth goes roundthe sun and that the stars are millions upon millions of ki-lometres away. But what of it? Do you suppose it is beyondus to produce a dual system of astronomy? The stars can benear or distant, according as we need them. Do you supposeour mathematicians are unequal to that? Have you forgot-ten doublethink?'

Winston shrank back upon the bed. Whatever he said,the swift answer crushed him like a bludgeon. And yet heknew, he KNEW, that he was in the right. The belief thatnothing exists outside your own mind—surely there mustbe some way of demonstrating that it was false? Had it notbeen exposed long ago as a fallacy? There was even a namefor it, which he had forgotten. A faint smile twitched thecorners of O'Brien's mouth as he looked down at him.

T told you, Winston,' he said, 'that metaphysics is notyour strong point. The word you are trying to think of is

solipsism. But you are mistaken. This is not solipsism. Col-lective solipsism, if you like. But that is a different thing: infact, the opposite thing. All this is a digression,' he addedin a different tone. 'The real power, the power we have tofight for night and day, is not power over things, but overmen.' He paused, and for a moment assumed again his airof a schoolmaster questioning a promising pupil: 'How doesone man assert his power over another, Winston?'

Winston thought. 'By making him suffer,' he said.

'Exactly By making him suffer. Obedience is not enough.Unless he is suffering, how can you be sure that he is obey-ing your will and not his own? Power is in inflicting painand humiliation. Power is in tearing human minds to piecesand putting them together again in new shapes of your ownchoosing. Do you begin to see, then, what kind of world weare creating? It is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonis-tic Utopias that the old reformers imagined. A world of fearand treachery and torment, a world of trampling and beingtrampled upon, a world which will grow not less but MOREmerciless as it refines itself. Progress in our world will beprogress towards more pain. The old civilizations claimedthat they were founded on love or justice. Ours is foundedupon hatred. In our world there will be no emotions ex-cept fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement. Everythingelse we shall destroy—everything. Already we are break-ing down the habits of thought which have survived frombefore the Revolution. We have cut the links between childand parent, and between man and man, and between manand woman. No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend

any longer. But in the future there will be no wives andno friends. Children will be taken from their mothers atbirth, as one takes eggs from a hen. The sex instinct will beeradicated. Procreation will be an annual formality like therenewal of a ration card. We shall abolish the orgasm. Ourneurologists are at work upon it now. There will be no loy-alty, except loyalty towards the Party. There will be no love,except the love of Big Brother. There will be no laughter, ex-cept the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy. There willbe no art, no literature, no science. When we are omnipo-tent we shall have no more need of science. There will be nodistinction between beauty and ugliness. There will be nocuriosity, no enjoyment of the process of life. All competingpleasures will be destroyed. But always—do not forget this,Winston—always there will be the intoxication of power,constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler. Al-ways, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory,the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. Ifyou want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stampingon a human face—for ever.'

He paused as though he expected Winston to speak.Winston had tried to shrink back into the surface of the bedagain. He could not say anything. His heart seemed to befrozen. O'Brien went on:

And remember that it is for ever. The face will alwaysbe there to be stamped upon. The heretic, the enemy of so-ciety, will always be there, so that he can be defeated andhumiliated over again. Everything that you have undergonesince you have been in our hands—all that will continue,

and worse. The espionage, the betrayals, the arrests, the tor-tures, the executions, the disappearances will never cease.It will be a world of terror as much as a world of triumph.The more the Party is powerful, the less it will be tolerant:the weaker the opposition, the tighter the despotism. Gold-stein and his heresies will live for ever. Every day, at everymoment, they will be defeated, discredited, ridiculed, spatupon and yet they will always survive. This drama that Ihave played out with you during seven years will be playedout over and over again generation after generation, alwaysin subtler forms. Always we shall have the heretic here at ourmercy, screaming with pain, broken up, contemptible—andin the end utterly penitent, saved from himself, crawling toour feet of his own accord. That is the world that we are pre-paring, Winston. A world of victory after victory, triumphafter triumph after triumph: an endless pressing, pressing,pressing upon the nerve of power. You are beginning, I cansee, to realize what that world will be like. But in the endyou will do more than understand it. You will accept it, wel-come it, become part of it.'

Winston had recovered himself sufficiently to speak.'You can't!' he said weakly.

'What do you mean by that remark, Winston?'

'You could not create such a world as you have just de-scribed. It is a dream. It is impossible.'

'Why?'

'It is impossible to found a civilization on fear and hatredand cruelty. It would never endure.'

'Why not?'

338 1984

'It would have no vitality. It would disintegrate. It wouldcommit suicide.'

'Nonsense. You are under the impression that hatred ismore exhausting than love. Why should it be? And if it were,what difference would that make? Suppose that we chooseto wear ourselves out faster. Suppose that we quicken thetempo of human life till men are senile at thirty. Still whatdifference would it make? Can you not understand that thedeath of the individual is not death? The party is immor-tal.'

As usual, the voice had battered Winston into helpless-ness. Moreover he was in dread that if he persisted in hisdisagreement O'Brien would twist the dial again. And yethe could not keep silent. Feebly, without arguments, withnothing to support him except his inarticulate horror ofwhat O'Brien had said, he returned to the attack.

'I don't know—I don't care. Somehow you will fail. Some-thing will defeat you. Life will defeat you.'

'We control life, Winston, at all its levels. You are imag-ining that there is something called human nature whichwill be outraged by what we do and will turn against us. Butwe create human nature. Men are infinitely malleable. Orperhaps you have returned to your old idea that the prole-tarians or the slaves will arise and overthrow us. Put it outof your mind. They are helpless, like the animals. Humanityis the Party. The others are outside—irrelevant.'

'I don't care. In the end they will beat you. Sooner or laterthey will see you for what you are, and then they will tearyou to pieces.'

'Do you see any evidence that that is happening? Or anyreason why it should?'

'No. I believe it. I KNOW that you will fail. There issomething in the universe—I don't know, some spirit, someprinciple—that you will never overcome.'

'Do you believe in God, Winston?'

'No.'

'Then what is it, this principle that will defeat us?'

'I don't know. The spirit of Man.'

'And do you consider yourself a man?'

'Yes.'

'If you are a man, Winston, you are the last man. Yourkind is extinct; we are the inheritors. Do you understandthat you are ALONE? You are outside history, you are non-existent.' His manner changed and he said more harshly:And you consider yourself morally superior to us, with ourlies and our cruelty?'

'Yes, I consider myself superior.'

O'Brien did not speak. Two other voices were speaking.After a moment Winston recognized one of them as hisown. It was a sound-track of the conversation he had hadwith O'Brien, on the night when he had enrolled himself inthe Brotherhood. He heard himself promising to lie, to steal,to forge, to murder, to encourage drug-taking and prosti-tution, to disseminate venereal diseases, to throw vitriolin a child's face. O'Brien made a small impatient gesture,as though to say that the demonstration was hardly worthmaking. Then he turned a switch and the voices stopped.

'Get up from that bed,' he said.

1984

The bonds had loosened themselves. Winston loweredhimself to the floor and stood up unsteadily.

'You are the last man,' said O'Brien. 'You are the guard-ian of the human spirit. You shall see yourself as you are.Take off your clothes.'

Winston undid the bit of string that held his overalls to-gether. The zip fastener had long since been wrenched out ofthem. He could not remember whether at any time since hisarrest he had taken off all his clothes at one time. Beneaththe overalls his body was looped with filthy yellowish rags,just recognizable as the remnants of underclothes. As heslid them to the ground he saw that there was a three-sidedmirror at the far end of the room. He approached it, thenstopped short. An involuntary cry had broken out of him.

'Go on,' said O'Brien. 'Stand between the wings of themirror. You shall see the side view as well'

He had stopped because he was frightened. A bowed,grey-coloured, skeleton-like thing was coming towardshim. Its actual appearance was frightening, and not merelythe fact that he knew it to be himself. He moved closer tothe glass. The creature's face seemed to be protruded, be-cause of its bent carriage. A forlorn, jailbird's face with anobby forehead running back into a bald scalp, a crookednose, and battered-looking cheekbones above which hiseyes were fierce and watchful. The cheeks were seamed, themouth had a drawn-in look. Certainly it was his own face,but it seemed to him that it had changed more than he hadchanged inside. The emotions it registered would be differ-ent from the ones he felt. He had gone partially bald. For the

first moment he had thought that he had gone grey as well,but it was only the scalp that was grey. Except for his handsand a circle of his face, his body was grey all over with an-cient, ingrained dirt. Here and there under the dirt therewere the red scars of wounds, and near the ankle the vari-cose ulcer was an inflamed mass with flakes of skin peelingoff it. But the truly frightening thing was the emaciation ofhis body. The barrel of the ribs was as narrow as that of askeleton: the legs had shrunk so that the knees were thickerthan the thighs. He saw now what O'Brien had meant aboutseeing the side view. The curvature of the spine was aston-ishing. The thin shoulders were hunched forward so as tomake a cavity of the chest, the scraggy neck seemed to bebending double under the weight of the skull. At a guess hewould have said that it was the body of a man of sixty, suf-fering from some malignant disease.

'You have thought sometimes,' said O'Brien, 'that myface—the face of a member of the Inner Party—looks oldand worn. What do you think of your own face?'

He seized Winston's shoulder and spun him round sothat he was facing him.

'Look at the condition you are in!' he said. 'Look at thisfilthy grime all over your body. Look at the dirt betweenyour toes. Look at that disgusting running sore on your leg.Do you know that you stink like a goat? Probably you haveceased to notice it. Look at your emaciation. Do you see? Ican make my thumb and forefinger meet round your bicep.I could snap your neck like a carrot. Do you know that youhave lost twenty-five kilograms since you have been in our

hands? Even your hair is coming out in handfuls. Look!' Heplucked at Winston's head and brought away a tuft of hair.'Open your mouth. Nine, ten, eleven teeth left. How manyhad you when you came to us? And the few you have left aredropping out of your head. Look here!'

He seized one of Winston's remaining front teeth be-tween his powerful thumb and forefinger. A twinge of painshot through Winston's jaw. O'Brien had wrenched theloose tooth out by the roots. He tossed it across the cell.

'You are rotting away' he said; 'you are falling to pieces.What are you? A bag of filth. Now turn around and lookinto that mirror again. Do you see that thing facing you?That is the last man. If you are human, that is humanity.Now put your clothes on again.'

Winston began to dress himself with slow stiff move-ments. Until now he had not seemed to notice how thin andweak he was. Only one thought stirred in his mind: that hemust have been in this place longer than he had imagined.Then suddenly as he fixed the miserable rags round himselfa feeling of pity for his ruined body overcame him. Beforehe knew what he was doing he had collapsed on to a smallstool that stood beside the bed and burst into tears. He wasaware of his ugliness, his gracelessness, a bundle of bones infilthy underclothes sitting weeping in the harsh white light:but he could not stop himself. O'Brien laid a hand on hisshoulder, almost kindly.

'It will not last for ever,' he said. 'You can escape from itwhenever you choose. Everything depends on yourself

'You did it!' sobbed Winston. 'You reduced me to this

state.

'No, Winston, you reduced yourself to it. This is what youaccepted when you set yourself up against the Party. It wasall contained in that first act. Nothing has happened thatyou did not foresee.'

He paused, and then went on:

'We have beaten you, Winston. We have broken you up.You have seen what your body is like. Your mind is in thesame state. I do not think there can be much pride left inyou. You have been kicked and flogged and insulted, youhave screamed with pain, you have rolled on the floor inyour own blood and vomit. You have whimpered for mercy,you have betrayed everybody and everything. Can you thinkof a single degradation that has not happened to you?'

Winston had stopped weeping, though the tears werestill oozing out of his eyes. He looked up at O'Brien.

'I have not betrayed Julia,' he said.

O'Brien looked down at him thoughtfully. 'No,' he said;'no; that is perfectly true. You have not betrayed Julia.'

The peculiar reverence for O'Brien, which nothingseemed able to destroy, flooded Winston's heart again. Howintelligent, he thought, how intelligent! Never did O'Brienfail to understand what was said to him. Anyone else onearth would have answered promptly that he HAD be-trayed Julia. For what was there that they had not screwedout of him under the torture? He had told them everythinghe knew about her, her habits, her character, her past life;he had confessed in the most trivial detail everything thathad happened at their meetings, all that he had said to her

1984

and she to him, their black-market meals, their adulteries,their vague plottings against the Party—everything. Andyet, in the sense in which he intended the word, he had notbetrayed her. He had not stopped loving her; his feelings to-wards her had remained the same. O'Brien had seen whathe meant without the need for explanation.

'Tell me,' he said, 'how soon will they shoot me?''It might be a long time,' said O'Brien. 'You are a difficultcase. But don't give up hope. Everyone is cured sooner orlater. In the end we shall shoot you.'

He was much better. He was growing fatter and strongerevery day, if it was proper to speak of days.

The white light and the humming sound were the sameas ever, but the cell was a little more comfortable than theothers he had been in. There was a pillow and a mattress onthe plank bed, and a stool to sit on. They had given him abath, and they allowed him to wash himself fairly frequent-ly in a tin basin. They even gave him warm water to washwith. They had given him new underclothes and a clean suitof overalls. They had dressed his varicose ulcer with sooth-ing ointment. They had pulled out the remnants of his teethand given him a new set of dentures.

Weeks or months must have passed. It would have beenpossible now to keep count of the passage of time, if he hadfelt any interest in doing so, since he was being fed at whatappeared to be regular intervals. He was getting, he judged,three meals in the twenty-four hours; sometimes he won-dered dimly whether he was getting them by night or by day.The food was surprisingly good, with meat at every thirdmeal. Once there was even a packet of cigarettes. He hadno matches, but the never-speaking guard who brought hisfood would give him a light. The first time he tried to smokeit made him sick, but he persevered, and spun the packet outfor a long time, smoking half a cigarette after each meal.

346 1984

They had given him a white slate with a stump of penciltied to the corner. At first he made no use of it. Even whenhe was awake he was completely torpid. Often he would liefrom one meal to the next almost without stirring, some-times asleep, sometimes waking into vague reveries in whichit was too much trouble to open his eyes. He had long grownused to sleeping with a strong light on his face. It seemedto make no difference, except that one's dreams were morecoherent. He dreamed a great deal all through this time,and they were always happy dreams. He was in the GoldenCountry, or he was sitting among enormous glorious, sunlitruins, with his mother, with Julia, with O'Brien—not do-ing anything, merely sitting in the sun, talking of peacefulthings. Such thoughts as he had when he was awake weremostly about his dreams. He seemed to have lost the powerof intellectual effort, now that the stimulus of pain had beenremoved. He was not bored, he had no desire for conversa-tion or distraction. Merely to be alone, not to be beaten orquestioned, to have enough to eat, and to be clean all over,was completely satisfying.

By degrees he came to spend less time in sleep, but he stillfelt no impulse to get off the bed. All he cared for was to liequiet and feel the strength gathering in his body. He wouldfinger himself here and there, trying to make sure that itwas not an illusion that his muscles were growing round-er and his skin tauter. Finally it was established beyond adoubt that he was growing fatter; his thighs were now defi-nitely thicker than his knees. After that, reluctantly at first,he began exercising himself regularly. In a little while he

could walk three kilometres, measured by pacing the cell,and his bowed shoulders were growing straighter. He at-tempted more elaborate exercises, and was astonished andhumiliated to find what things he could not do. He couldnot move out of a walk, he could not hold his stool out atarm's length, he could not stand on one leg without fallingover. He squatted down on his heels, and found that withagonizing pains in thigh and calf he could just lift himselfto a standing position. He lay flat on his belly and tried tolift his weight by his hands. It was hopeless, he could notraise himself a centimetre. But after a few more days—a fewmore mealtimes—even that feat was accomplished. A timecame when he could do it six times running. He began togrow actually proud of his body, and to cherish an inter-mittent belief that his face also was growing back to normal.Only when he chanced to put his hand on his bald scalp didhe remember the seamed, ruined face that had looked backat him out of the mirror.

His mind grew more active. He sat down on the plankbed, his back against the wall and the slate on his knees,and set to work deliberately at the task of re-educating him-self.

He had capitulated, that was agreed. In reality, as he sawnow, he had been ready to capitulate long before he hadtaken the decision. From the moment when he was insidethe Ministry of Love—and yes, even during those minuteswhen he and Julia had stood helpless while the iron voicefrom the telescreen told them what to do—he had graspedthe frivolity, the shallowness of his attempt to set himself

348 1984

up against the power of the Party. He knew now that forseven years the Thought Police had watched him like a bee-tle under a magnifying glass. There was no physical act, noword spoken aloud, that they had not noticed, no train ofthought that they had not been able to infer. Even the speckof whitish dust on the cover of his diary they had careful-ly replaced. They had played sound-tracks to him, shownhim photographs. Some of them were photographs of Juliaand himself. Yes, even... He could not fight against the Partyany longer. Besides, the Party was in the right. It must beso; how could the immortal, collective brain be mistaken?By what external standard could you check its judgements?Sanity was statistical. It was merely a question of learning

to think as they thought. Only !

The pencil felt thick and awkward in his fingers. He be-gan to write down the thoughts that came into his head. Hewrote first in large clumsy capitals:

FREEDOM IS SLAVERY

Then almost without a pause he wrote beneath it:

TWO AND TWO MAKE FIVE

But then there came a sort of check. His mind, as thoughshying away from something, seemed unable to concen-trate. He knew that he knew what came next, but for themoment he could not recall it. When he did recall it, it wasonly by consciously reasoning out what it must be: it did not

come of its own accord. He wrote:GOD IS POWER

He accepted everything. The past was alterable. The pastnever had been altered. Oceania was at war with Eastasia.Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia. Jones, Aar-onson, and Rutherford were guilty of the crimes they werecharged with. He had never seen the photograph that dis-proved their guilt. It had never existed, he had invented it.He remembered remembering contrary things, but thosewere false memories, products of self-deception. How easy itall was! Only surrender, and everything else followed. It waslike swimming against a current that swept you backwardshowever hard you struggled, and then suddenly deciding toturn round and go with the current instead of opposing it.Nothing had changed except your own attitude: the predes-tined thing happened in any case. He hardly knew why hehad ever rebelled. Everything was easy, except !

Anything could be true. The so-called laws of Na-ture were nonsense. The law of gravity was nonsense. 'If Iwished,' O'Brien had said, 'I could float off this floor likea soap bubble.' Winston worked it out. 'If he THINKS hefloats off the floor, and if I simultaneously THINK I seehim do it, then the thing happens.' Suddenly, like a lumpof submerged wreckage breaking the surface of water, thethought burst into his mind: 'It doesn't really happen. Weimagine it. It is hallucination.' He pushed the thought un-der instantly. The fallacy was obvious. It presupposed that

1984

somewhere or other, outside oneself, there was a 'real' worldwhere 'real' things happened. But how could there be such aworld? What knowledge have we of anything, save throughour own minds? All happenings are in the mind. Whateverhappens in all minds, truly happens.

He had no difficulty in disposing of the fallacy, and hewas in no danger of succumbing to it. He realized, never-theless, that it ought never to have occurred to him. Themind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerousthought presented itself. The process should be automatic,instinctive. CRIMESTOP, they called it in Newspeak.

He set to work to exercise himself in crimestop. He pre-sented himself with propositions—'the Party says the earthis flat', 'the party says that ice is heavier than water'—andtrained himself in not seeing or not understanding the ar-guments that contradicted them. It was not easy. It neededgreat powers of reasoning and improvisation. The arith-metical problems raised, for instance, by such a statementas 'two and two make five' were beyond his intellectualgrasp. It needed also a sort of athleticism of mind, an abilityat one moment to make the most delicate use of logic andat the next to be unconscious of the crudest logical errors.Stupidity was as necessary as intelligence, and as difficultto attain.

All the while, with one part of his mind, he wonderedhow soon they would shoot him. 'Everything depends onyourself,' O'Brien had said; but he knew that there was noconscious act by which he could bring it nearer. It mightbe ten minutes hence, or ten years. They might keep him

for years in solitary confinement, they might send him toa labour-camp, they might release him for a while, as theysometimes did. It was perfectly possible that before he wasshot the whole drama of his arrest and interrogation wouldbe enacted all over again. The one certain thing was thatdeath never came at an expected moment. The tradition—the unspoken tradition: somehow you knew it, though younever heard it said—was that they shot you from behind;always in the back of the head, without warning, as youwalked down a corridor from cell to cell.

One day—but 'one day' was not the right expression; justas probably it was in the middle of the night: once—he fellinto a strange, blissful reverie. He was walking down thecorridor, waiting for the bullet. He knew that it was com-ing in another moment. Everything was settled, smoothedout, reconciled. There were no more doubts, no more argu-ments, no more pain, no more fear. His body was healthyand strong. He walked easily, with a joy of movement andwith a feeling of walking in sunlight. He was not any longerin the narrow white corridors in the Ministry of Love, hewas in the enormous sunlit passage, a kilometre wide, downwhich he had seemed to walk in the delirium induced bydrugs. He was in the Golden Country, following the foot-track across the old rabbit-cropped pasture. He could feelthe short springy turf under his feet and the gentle sun-shine on his face. At the edge of the field were the elm trees,faintly stirring, and somewhere beyond that was the streamwhere the dace lay in the green pools under the willows.

Suddenly he started up with a shock of horror. The

1984

sweat broke out on his backbone. He had heard himself cryaloud:

'Julia! Julia! Julia, my love! Julia!'

For a moment he had had an overwhelming hallucina-tion of her presence. She had seemed to be not merely withhim, but inside him. It was as though she had got into thetexture of his skin. In that moment he had loved her farmore than he had ever done when they were together andfree. Also he knew that somewhere or other she was stillalive and needed his help.

He lay back on the bed and tried to compose himself.What had he done? How many years had he added to hisservitude by that moment of weakness?

In another moment he would hear the tramp of bootsoutside. They could not let such an outburst go unpunished.They would know now, if they had not known before, thathe was breaking the agreement he had made with them. Heobeyed the Party, but he still hated the Party. In the olddays he had hidden a heretical mind beneath an appear-ance of conformity. Now he had retreated a step further:in the mind he had surrendered, but he had hoped to keepthe inner heart inviolate. He knew that he was in the wrong,but he preferred to be in the wrong. They would understandthat—O'Brien would understand it. It was all confessed inthat single foolish cry.

He would have to start all over again. It might take years.He ran a hand over his face, trying to familiarize himselfwith the new shape. There were deep furrows in the cheeks,the cheekbones felt sharp, the nose flattened. Besides, since

last seeing himself in the glass he had been given a completenew set of teeth. It was not easy to preserve inscrutabili-ty when you did not know what your face looked like. Inany case, mere control of the features was not enough. Forthe first time he perceived that if you want to keep a secretyou must also hide it from yourself. You must know all thewhile that it is there, but until it is needed you must never letit emerge into your consciousness in any shape that couldbe given a name. From now onwards he must not only thinkright; he must feel right, dream right. And all the while hemust keep his hatred locked up inside him like a ball ofmatter which was part of himself and yet unconnected withthe rest of him, a kind of cyst.

One day they would decide to shoot him. You could nottell when it would happen, but a few seconds beforehandit should be possible to guess. It was always from behind,walking down a corridor. Ten seconds would be enough. Inthat time the world inside him could turn over. And thensuddenly, without a word uttered, without a check in hisstep, without the changing of a line in his face—suddenlythe camouflage would be down and bang! would go the bat-teries of his hatred. Hatred would fill him like an enormousroaring flame. And almost in the same instant bang! wouldgo the bullet, too late, or too early. They would have blownhis brain to pieces before they could reclaim it. The hereti-cal thought would be unpunished, unrepented, out of theirreach for ever. They would have blown a hole in their ownperfection. To die hating them, that was freedom.

He shut his eyes. It was more difficult than accepting

1984

an intellectual discipline. It was a question of degradinghimself, mutilating himself. He had got to plunge into thefilthiest of filth. What was the most horrible, sickening thingof all? He thought of Big Brother. The enormous face (be-cause of constantly seeing it on posters he always thoughtof it as being a metre wide), with its heavy black moustacheand the eyes that followed you to and fro, seemed to floatinto his mind of its own accord. What were his true feelingstowards Big Brother?

There was a heavy tramp of boots in the passage. Thesteel door swung open with a clang. O'Brien walked intothe cell. Behind him were the waxen-faced officer and theblack-uniformed guards.

'Get up,' said O'Brien. 'Come here.'

Winston stood opposite him. O'Brien took Winston'sshoulders between his strong hands and looked at himclosely.

'You have had thoughts of deceiving me,' he said. "Thatwas stupid. Stand up straighter. Look me in the face.'

He paused, and went on in a gentler tone:

'You are improving. Intellectually there is very littlewrong with you. It is only emotionally that you have failedto make progress. Tell me, Winston—and remember, nolies: you know that I am always able to detect a lie—tell me,what are your true feelings towards Big Brother?'

T hate him.'

'You hate him. Good. Then the time has come for youto take the last step. You must love Big Brother. It is notenough to obey him: you must love him.'

He released Winston with a little push towards theguards.

'Room 101,' he said.

356 1984

Chapter 5

At each stage of his imprisonment he had known, orseemed to know, whereabouts he was in the window-less building. Possibly there were slight differences in the airpressure. The cells where the guards had beaten him werebelow ground level. The room where he had been interro-gated by O'Brien was high up near the roof. This place wasmany metres underground, as deep down as it was possibleto go.

It was bigger than most of the cells he had been in. Buthe hardly noticed his surroundings. All he noticed was thatthere were two small tables straight in front of him, eachcovered with green baize. One was only a metre or twofrom him, the other was further away, near the door. Hewas strapped upright in a chair, so tightly that he couldmove nothing, not even his head. A sort of pad gripped hishead from behind, forcing him to look straight in front ofhim.

For a moment he was alone, then the door opened andO'Brien came in.

'You asked me once,' said O'Brien, 'what was in Room101.1 told you that you knew the answer already. Everyoneknows it. The thing that is in Room 101 is the worst thingin the world.'

The door opened again. A guard came in, carrying some-

thing made of wire, a box or basket of some kind. He setit down on the further table. Because of the position inwhich O'Brien was standing. Winston could not see whatthe thing was.

"The worst thing in the world,' said O'Brien, 'varies fromindividual to individual. It may be burial alive, or death byfire, or by drowning, or by impalement, or fifty other deaths.There are cases where it is some quite trivial thing, not evenfatal'

He had moved a little to one side, so that Winston had abetter view of the thing on the table. It was an oblong wirecage with a handle on top for carrying it by. Fixed to thefront of it was something that looked like a fencing mask,with the concave side outwards. Although it was three orfour metres away from him, he could see that the cage wasdivided lengthways into two compartments, and that therewas some kind of creature in each. They were rats.

'In your case,' said O'Brien, 'the worst thing in the worldhappens to be rats.'

A sort of premonitory tremor, a fear of he was not certainwhat, had passed through Winston as soon as he caught hisfirst glimpse of the cage. But at this moment the meaning ofthe mask-like attachment in front of it suddenly sank intohim. His bowels seemed to turn to water.

'You can't do that!' he cried out in a high cracked voice.'You couldn't, you couldn't! It's impossible.'

'Do you remember,' said O'Brien, 'the moment of pan-ic that used to occur in your dreams? There was a wall ofblackness in front of you, and a roaring sound in your ears.

358 1984

There was something terrible on the other side of the wall.You knew that you knew what it was, but you dared not dragit into the open. It was the rats that were on the other sideof the wall'

'O'Brien!' said Winston, making an effort to control hisvoice. 'You know this is not necessary. What is it that youwant me to do?'

O'Brien made no direct answer. When he spoke it wasin the schoolmasterish manner that he sometimes affected.He looked thoughtfully into the distance, as though he wereaddressing an audience somewhere behind Winston's back.

'By itself,' he said, 'pain is not always enough. Thereare occasions when a human being will stand out againstpain, even to the point of death. But for everyone there issomething unendurable—something that cannot be con-templated. Courage and cowardice are not involved. If youare falling from a height it is not cowardly to clutch at arope. If you have come up from deep water it is not coward-ly to fill your lungs with air. It is merely an instinct whichcannot be destroyed. It is the same with the rats. For you,they are unendurable. They are a form of pressure that youcannot withstand, even if you wished to. You will do whatis required of you.'

'But what is it, what is it? How can I do it if I don't knowwhat it is?'

O'Brien picked up the cage and brought it across to thenearer table. He set it down carefully on the baize cloth.Winston could hear the blood singing in his ears. He had thefeeling of sitting in utter loneliness. He was in the middle

of a great empty plain, a flat desert drenched with sunlight,across which all sounds came to him out of immense dis-tances. Yet the cage with the rats was not two metres awayfrom him. They were enormous rats. They were at the agewhen a rat's muzzle grows blunt and fierce and his fur browninstead of grey.

'The rat,' said O'Brien, still addressing his invisible audi-ence, 'although a rodent, is carnivorous. You are aware ofthat. You will have heard of the things that happen in thepoor quarters of this town. In some streets a woman darenot leave her baby alone in the house, even for five minutes.The rats are certain to attack it. Within quite a small timethey will strip it to the bones. They also attack sick or dy-ing people. They show astonishing intelligence in knowingwhen a human being is helpless.'

There was an outburst of squeals from the cage. It seemedto reach Winston from far away. The rats were fighting; theywere trying to get at each other through the partition. Heheard also a deep groan of despair. That, too, seemed tocome from outside himself.

O'Brien picked up the cage, and, as he did so, pressedsomething in it. There was a sharp click. Winston madea frantic effort to tear himself loose from the chair. It washopeless; every part of him, even his head, was held im-movably. O'Brien moved the cage nearer. It was less than ametre from Winston's face.

T have pressed the first lever,' said O'Brien. 'You under-stand the construction of this cage. The mask will fit overyour head, leaving no exit. When I press this other lever,

360 1984

the door of the cage will slide up. These starving brutes willshoot out of it like bullets. Have you ever seen a rat leapthrough the air? They will leap on to your face and borestraight into it. Sometimes they attack the eyes first. Some-times they burrow through the cheeks and devour thetongue.'

The cage was nearer; it was closing in. Winston heard asuccession of shrill cries which appeared to be occurring inthe air above his head. But he fought furiously against hispanic. To think, to think, even with a split second left—tothink was the only hope. Suddenly the foul musty odour ofthe brutes struck his nostrils. There was a violent convul-sion of nausea inside him, and he almost lost consciousness.Everything had gone black. For an instant he was insane, ascreaming animal. Yet he came out of the blackness clutch-ing an idea. There was one and only one way to save himself.He must interpose another human being, the BODY of an-other human being, between himself and the rats.

The circle of the mask was large enough now to shut outthe vision of anything else. The wire door was a couple ofhand-spans from his face. The rats knew what was comingnow. One of them was leaping up and down, the other, anold scaly grandfather of the sewers, stood up, with his pinkhands against the bars, and fiercely sniffed the air. Winstoncould see the whiskers and the yellow teeth. Again the blackpanic took hold of him. He was blind, helpless, mindless.

'It was a common punishment in Imperial China,' saidO'Brien as didactically as ever.

The mask was closing on his face. The wire brushed his

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 361

cheek. And then—no, it was not relief, only hope, a tinyfragment of hope. Too late, perhaps too late. But he hadsuddenly understood that in the whole world there was justONE person to whom he could transfer his punishment—ONE body that he could thrust between himself and therats. And he was shouting frantically, over and over.

'Do it to Julia! Do it to Julia! Not me! Julia! I don't carewhat you do to her. Tear her face off, strip her to the bones.Not me! Julia! Not me!'

He was falling backwards, into enormous depths, awayfrom the rats. He was still strapped in the chair, but he hadfallen through the floor, through the walls of the build-ing, through the earth, through the oceans, through theatmosphere, into outer space, into the gulfs between thestars—always away, away, away from the rats. He was lightyears distant, but O'Brien was still standing at his side.There was still the cold touch of wire against his cheek. Butthrough the darkness that enveloped him he heard anothermetallic click, and knew that the cage door had clicked shutand not open.

Chapter 6

The Chestnut Tree was almost empty. A ray of sunlightslanting through a window fell on dusty table-tops. Itwas the lonely hour of fifteen. A tinny music trickled fromthe telescreens.

Winston sat in his usual corner, gazing into an emptyglass. Now and again he glanced up at a vast face which eyedhim from the opposite wall. BIG BROTHER IS WATCH-ING YOU, the caption said. Unbidden, a waiter came andfilled his glass up with Victory Gin, shaking into it a fewdrops from another bottle with a quill through the cork. Itwas saccharine flavoured with cloves, the speciality of thecafe.

Winston was listening to the telescreen. At present onlymusic was coming out of it, but there was a possibility thatat any moment there might be a special bulletin from theMinistry of Peace. The news from the African front was dis-quieting in the extreme. On and off he had been worryingabout it all day. A Eurasian army (Oceania was at war withEurasia: Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia) wasmoving southward at terrifying speed. The mid-day bulle-tin had not mentioned any definite area, but it was probablethat already the mouth of the Congo was a battlefield. Braz-zaville and Leopoldville were in danger. One did not haveto look at the map to see what it meant. It was not merely

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 363

a question of losing Central Africa: for the first time in thewhole war, the territory of Oceania itself was menaced.

A violent emotion, not fear exactly but a sort of undif-ferentiated excitement, flared up in him, then faded again.He stopped thinking about the war. In these days he couldnever fix his mind on any one subject for more than a fewmoments at a time. He picked up his glass and drained itat a gulp. As always, the gin made him shudder and evenretch slightly. The stuff was horrible. The cloves and sac-charine, themselves disgusting enough in their sickly way,could not disguise the flat oily smell; and what was worstof all was that the smell of gin, which dwelt with him nightand day, was inextricably mixed up in his mind with thesmell of those

He never named them, even in his thoughts, and sofar as it was possible he never visualized them. They weresomething that he was half-aware of, hovering close to hisface, a smell that clung to his nostrils. As the gin rose inhim he belched through purple lips. He had grown fattersince they released him, and had regained his old colour—indeed, more than regained it. His features had thickened,the skin on nose and cheekbones was coarsely red, eventhe bald scalp was too deep a pink. A waiter, again unbid-den, brought the chessboard and the current issue of 'TheTimes', with the page turned down at the chess problem.Then, seeing that Winston's glass was empty, he brought thegin bottle and filled it. There was no need to give orders.They knew his habits. The chessboard was always waitingfor him, his corner table was always reserved; even when

364 1984

the place was full he had it to himself, since nobody caredto be seen sitting too close to him. He never even botheredto count his drinks. At irregular intervals they presentedhim with a dirty slip of paper which they said was the bill,but he had the impression that they always underchargedhim. It would have made no difference if it had been theother way about. He had always plenty of money nowadays.He even had a job, a sinecure, more highly-paid than his oldjob had been.

The music from the telescreen stopped and a voice tookover. Winston raised his head to listen. No bulletins fromthe front, however. It was merely a brief announcementfrom the Ministry of Plenty. In the preceding quarter, it ap-peared, the Tenth Three-Year Plan's quota for bootlaces hadbeen overfulfilled by 98 per cent.

He examined the chess problem and set out the pieces. Itwas a tricky ending, involving a couple of knights. 'White toplay and mate in two moves.' Winston looked up at the por-trait of Big Brother. White always mates, he thought with asort of cloudy mysticism. Always, without exception, it is soarranged. In no chess problem since the beginning of theworld has black ever won. Did it not symbolize the eternal,unvarying triumph of Good over Evil? The huge face gazedback at him, full of calm power. White always mates.

The voice from the telescreen paused and added in a dif-ferent and much graver tone: 'You are warned to stand byfor an important announcement at fifteen-thirty Fifteen-thirty! This is news of the highest importance. Take carenot to miss it. Fifteen-thirty!' The tinkling music struck up

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 365

again.

Winston's heart stirred. That was the bulletin from thefront; instinct told him that it was bad news that was com-ing. All day, with little spurts of excitement, the thoughtof a smashing defeat in Africa had been in and out of hismind. He seemed actually to see the Eurasian army swarm-ing across the never-broken frontier and pouring downinto the tip of Africa like a column of ants. Why had it notbeen possible to outflank them in some way? The outline ofthe West African coast stood out vividly in his mind. Hepicked up the white knight and moved it across the board.THERE was the proper spot. Even while he saw the blackhorde racing southward he saw another force, mysteriouslyassembled, suddenly planted in their rear, cutting their co-munications by land and sea. He felt that by willing it hewas bringing that other force into existence. But it was nec-essary to act quickly. If they could get control of the wholeof Africa, if they had airfields and submarine bases at theCape, it would cut Oceania in two. It might mean anything:defeat, breakdown, the redivision of the world, the destruc-tion of the Party! He drew a deep breath. An extraordinarymedley of feeling—but it was not a medley, exactly; rather itwas successive layers of feeling, in which one could not saywhich layer was undermost—struggled inside him.

The spasm passed. He put the white knight back in itsplace, but for the moment he could not settle down to se-rious study of the chess problem. His thoughts wanderedagain. Almost unconsciously he traced with his finger inthe dust on the table:

366 1984

"They can't get inside you,' she had said. But they couldget inside you. 'What happens to you here is FOR EVER,'O'Brien had said. That was a true word. There were things,your own acts, from which you could never recover. Some-thing was killed in your breast: burnt out, cauterized out.

He had seen her; he had even spoken to her. There wasno danger in it. He knew as though instinctively that theynow took almost no interest in his doings. He could havearranged to meet her a second time if either of them hadwanted to. Actually it was by chance that they had met. Itwas in the Park, on a vile, biting day in March, when theearth was like iron and all the grass seemed dead and therewas not a bud anywhere except a few crocuses which hadpushed themselves up to be dismembered by the wind. Hewas hurrying along with frozen hands and watering eyeswhen he saw her not ten metres away from him. It struckhim at once that she had changed in some ill-defined way.They almost passed one another without a sign, then heturned and followed her, not very eagerly. He knew thatthere was no danger, nobody would take any interest in him.She did not speak. She walked obliquely away across thegrass as though trying to get rid of him, then seemed to re-sign herself to having him at her side. Presently they were inamong a clump of ragged leafless shrubs, useless either forconcealment or as protection from the wind. They halted.It was vilely cold. The wind whistled through the twigs andfretted the occasional, dirty-looking crocuses. He put his

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 367

arm round her waist.

There was no telescreen, but there must be hiddenmicrophones: besides, they could be seen. It did not mat-ter, nothing mattered. They could have lain down on theground and done THAT if they had wanted to. His fleshfroze with horror at the thought of it. She made no responsewhatever to the clasp of his arm; she did not even try to dis-engage herself. He knew now what had changed in her. Herface was sallower, and there was a long scar, partly hiddenby the hair, across her forehead and temple; but that was notthe change. It was that her waist had grown thicker, and, ina surprising way, had stiffened. He remembered how once,after the explosion of a rocket bomb, he had helped to draga corpse out of some ruins, and had been astonished notonly by the incredible weight of the thing, but by its rigidityand awkwardness to handle, which made it seem more likestone than flesh. Her body felt like that. It occurred to himthat the texture of her skin would be quite different fromwhat it had once been.

He did not attempt to kiss her, nor did they speak. As theywalked back across the grass, she looked directly at him forthe first time. It was only a momentary glance, full of con-tempt and dislike. He wondered whether it was a dislike thatcame purely out of the past or whether it was inspired alsoby his bloated face and the water that the wind kept squeez-ing from his eyes. They sat down on two iron chairs, side byside but not too close together. He saw that she was aboutto speak. She moved her clumsy shoe a few centimetres anddeliberately crushed a twig. Her feet seemed to have grown

368 1984

broader, he noticed.

'I betrayed you,' she said baldly.

'I betrayed you,' he said.

She gave him another quick look of dislike.

'Sometimes,' she said, 'they threaten you with somethingsomething you can't stand up to, can't even think about.And then you say, 'Don't do it to me, do it to somebodyelse, do it to so-and-so.' And perhaps you might pretend,afterwards, that it was only a trick and that you just said itto make them stop and didn't really mean it. But that isn'ttrue. At the time when it happens you do mean it. You thinkthere's no other way of saving yourself, and you're quiteready to save yourself that way. You WANT it to happen tothe other person. You don't give a damn what they suffer.All you care about is yourself

All you care about is yourself,' he echoed.

And after that, you don't feel the same towards the otherperson any longer.'

'No,' he said, 'you don't feel the same.'

There did not seem to be anything more to say. The windplastered their thin overalls against their bodies. Almost atonce it became embarrassing to sit there in silence: besides,it was too cold to keep still. She said something about catch-ing her Tube and stood up to go.

'We must meet again,' he said.

'Yes,' she said, 'we must meet again.'

He followed irresolutely for a little distance, half a pacebehind her. They did not speak again. She did not actuallytry to shake him off, but walked at just such a speed as to

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 369

prevent his keeping abreast of her. He had made up his mindthat he would accompany her as far as the Tube station, butsuddenly this process of trailing along in the cold seemedpointless and unbearable. He was overwhelmed by a desirenot so much to get away from Julia as to get back to theChestnut Tree Cafe, which had never seemed so attractiveas at this moment. He had a nostalgic vision of his cornertable, with the newspaper and the chessboard and the ever-flowing gin. Above all, it would be warm in there. The nextmoment, not altogether by accident, he allowed himself tobecome separated from her by a small knot of people. Hemade a halfhearted attempt to catch up, then slowed down,turned, and made off in the opposite direction. When hehad gone fifty metres he looked back. The street was notcrowded, but already he could not distinguish her. Any oneof a dozen hurrying figures might have been hers. Perhapsher thickened, stiffened body was no longer recognizablefrom behind.

At the time when it happens,' she had said, 'you do meanit.' He had meant it. He had not merely said it, he had wishedit. He had wished that she and not he should be deliveredover to the

Something changed in the music that trickled from thetelescreen. A cracked and jeering note, a yellow note, cameinto it. And then—perhaps it was not happening, perhapsit was only a memory taking on the semblance of sound—avoice was singing:

'Under the spreading chestnut tree

370 1984

/ sold you and you sold me '

The tears welled up in his eyes. A passing waiter noticedthat his glass was empty and came back with the gin bottle.

He took up his glass and sniffed at it. The stuff grewnot less but more horrible with every mouthful he drank.But it had become the element he swam in. It was his life,his death, and his resurrection. It was gin that sank himinto stupor every night, and gin that revived him everymorning. When he woke, seldom before eleven hundred,with gummed-up eyelids and fiery mouth and a back thatseemed to be broken, it would have been impossible evento rise from the horizontal if it had not been for the bottleand teacup placed beside the bed overnight. Through themidday hours he sat with glazed face, the bottle handy, lis-tening to the telescreen. From fifteen to closing-time hewas a fixture in the Chestnut Tree. No one cared what hedid any longer, no whistle woke him, no telescreen admon-ished him. Occasionally, perhaps twice a week, he went to adusty, forgotten-looking office in the Ministry of Truth anddid a little work, or what was called work. He had been ap-pointed to a sub-committee of a sub-committee which hadsprouted from one of the innumerable committees dealingwith minor difficulties that arose in the compilation of theEleventh Edition of the Newspeak Dictionary. They wereengaged in producing something called an Interim Report,but what it was that they were reporting on he had neverdefinitely found out. It was something to do with the ques-tion of whether commas should be placed inside brackets,

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 371

or outside. There were four others on the committee, all ofthem persons similar to himself. There were days when theyassembled and then promptly dispersed again, frankly ad-mitting to one another that there was not really anything tobe done. But there were other days when they settled downto their work almost eagerly, making a tremendous showof entering up their minutes and drafting long memorandawhich were never finished—when the argument as to whatthey were supposedly arguing about grew extraordinarilyinvolved and abstruse, with subtle haggling over definitions,enormous digressions, quarrels—threats, even, to appeal tohigher authority. And then suddenly the life would go outof them and they would sit round the table looking at oneanother with extinct eyes, like ghosts fading at cock-crow.

The telescreen was silent for a moment. Winston raisedhis head again. The bulletin! But no, they were merelychanging the music. He had the map of Africa behind hiseyelids. The movement of the armies was a diagram: a blackarrow tearing vertically southward, and a white arrow hori-zontally eastward, across the tail of the first. As though forreassurance he looked up at the imperturbable face in theportrait. Was it conceivable that the second arrow did noteven exist?

His interest flagged again. He drank another mouthful ofgin, picked up the white knight and made a tentative move.Check. But it was evidently not the right move, because

Uncalled, a memory floated into his mind. He saw acandle-lit room with a vast white-counterpaned bed, andhimself, a boy of nine or ten, sitting on the floor, shaking

1984

a dice-box, and laughing excitedly. His mother was sittingopposite him and also laughing.

It must have been about a month before she disappeared.It was a moment of reconciliation, when the nagging hun-ger in his belly was forgotten and his earlier affection forher had temporarily revived. He remembered the day well,a pelting, drenching day when the water streamed downthe window-pane and the light indoors was too dull to readby. The boredom of the two children in the dark, crampedbedroom became unbearable. Winston whined and griz-zled, made futile demands for food, fretted about the roompulling everything out of place and kicking the wainscot-ing until the neighbours banged on the wall, while theyounger child wailed intermittently. In the end his mothersaid, 'Now be good, and I'll buy you a toy. A lovely toy—you'll love it'; and then she had gone out in the rain, to alittle general shop which was still sporadically open nearby,and came back with a cardboard box containing an outfitof Snakes and Ladders. He could still remember the smellof the damp cardboard. It was a miserable outfit. The boardwas cracked and the tiny wooden dice were so ill-cut thatthey would hardly lie on their sides. Winston looked at thething sulkily and without interest. But then his mother lit apiece of candle and they sat down on the floor to play. Soonhe was wildly excited and shouting with laughter as the tid-dly-winks climbed hopefully up the ladders and then cameslithering down the snakes again, almost to the starting-point. They played eight games, winning four each. His tinysister, too young to understand what the game was about,

had sat propped up against a bolster, laughing because theothers were laughing. For a whole afternoon they had allbeen happy together, as in his earlier childhood.

He pushed the picture out of his mind. It was a falsememory. He was troubled by false memories occasionally.They did not matter so long as one knew them for what theywere. Some things had happened, others had not happened.He turned back to the chessboard and picked up the whiteknight again. Almost in the same instant it dropped on tothe board with a clatter. He had started as though a pin hadrun into him.

A shrill trumpet-call had pierced the air. It was the bul-letin! Victory! It always meant victory when a trumpet-callpreceded the news. A sort of electric drill ran through thecafe. Even the waiters had started and pricked up theirears.

The trumpet-call had let loose an enormous volume ofnoise. Already an excited voice was gabbling from the tele-screen, but even as it started it was almost drowned by aroar of cheering from outside. The news had run round thestreets like magic. He could hear just enough of what wasissuing from the telescreen to realize that it had all hap-pened, as he had foreseen; a vast seaborne armada hadsecretly assembled a sudden blow in the enemy's rear, thewhite arrow tearing across the tail of the black. Fragmentsof triumphant phrases pushed themselves through the din:'Vast strategic manoeuvre—perfect co-ordination—utterrout—half a million prisoners—complete demoraliza-tion—control of the whole of Africa—bring the war within

1984

measurable distance of its end—victory—greatest victoryin human history—victory, victory, victory!'

Under the table Winston's feet made convulsive move-ments. He had not stirred from his seat, but in his mindhe was running, swiftly running, he was with the crowdsoutside, cheering himself deaf. He looked up again at theportrait of Big Brother. The colossus that bestrode theworld! The rock against which the hordes of Asia dashedthemselves in vain! He thought how ten minutes ago—yes,only ten minutes—there had still been equivocation inhis heart as he wondered whether the news from the frontwould be of victory or defeat. Ah, it was more than a Eur-asian army that had perished! Much had changed in himsince that first day in the Ministry of Love, but the final, in-dispensable, healing change had never happened, until thismoment.

The voice from the telescreen was still pouring forth itstale of prisoners and booty and slaughter, but the shoutingoutside had died down a little. The waiters were turningback to their work. One of them approached with the ginbottle. Winston, sitting in a blissful dream, paid no at-tention as his glass was filled up. He was not running orcheering any longer. He was back in the Ministry of Love,with everything forgiven, his soul white as snow. He was inthe public dock, confessing everything, implicating every-body. He was walking down the white-tiled corridor, withthe feeling of walking in sunlight, and an armed guard athis back. The long-hoped-for bullet was entering his brain.

He gazed up at the enormous face. Forty years it had tak-

en him to learn what kind of smile was hidden beneath thedark moustache. 0 cruel, needless misunderstanding! Ostubborn, self-willed exile from the loving breast! Two gin-scented tears trickled down the sides of his nose. But it wasall right, everything was all right, the struggle was finished.He had won the victory over himself. He loved Big Brother.

THE END

APPENDIX.

The Principles of Newspeak

Newspeak was the official language of Oceania andhad been devised to meet the ideological needs of Ingsoc,or English Socialism. In the year 1984 there was not as yetanyone who used Newspeak as his sole means of commu-nication, either in speech or writing. The leading articlesin 'The Times' were written in it, but this was a TOUR DEFORCE which could only be carried out by a specialist. Itwas expected that Newspeak would have finally supersed-ed Oldspeak (or Standard English, as we should call it) byabout the year 2050. Meanwhile it gained ground steadi-ly, all Party members tending to use Newspeak words andgrammatical constructions more and more in their every-day speech. The version in use in 1984, and embodied in theNinth and Tenth Editions of the Newspeak Dictionary, wasa provisional one, and contained many superfluous wordsand archaic formations which were due to be suppressedlater. It is with the final, perfected version, as embodied inthe Eleventh Edition of the Dictionary, that we are con-cerned here.

The purpose of Newspeak was not only to provide a

376 1984

medium of expression for the world-view and mental hab-its proper to the devotees of Ingsoc, but to make all othermodes of thought impossible. It was intended that whenNewspeak had been adopted once and for all and Oldspeakforgotten, a heretical thought—that is, a thought divergingfrom the principles of Ingsoc—should be literally unthink-able, at least so far as thought is dependent on words. Itsvocabulary was so constructed as to give exact and of-ten very subtle expression to every meaning that a Partymember could properly wish to express, while excludingall other meanings and also the possibility of arriving atthem by indirect methods. This was done partly by theinvention of new words, but chiefly by eliminating unde-sirable words and by stripping such words as remained ofunorthodox meanings, and so far as possible of all second-ary meanings whatever. To give a single example. The wordFREE still existed in Newspeak, but it could only be used insuch statements as 'This dog is free from lice' or "This fieldis free from weeds'. It could not be used in its old sense of'politically free' or 'intellectually free' since political and in-tellectual freedom no longer existed even as concepts, andwere therefore of necessity nameless. Quite apart from thesuppression of definitely heretical words, reduction of vo-cabulary was regarded as an end in itself, and no word thatcould be dispensed with was allowed to survive. Newspeakwas designed not to extend but to DIMINISH the range ofthought, and this purpose was indirectly assisted by cuttingthe choice of words down to a minimum.

Newspeak was founded on the English language as we

now know it, though many Newspeak sentences, even whennot containing newly-created words, would be barely intel-ligible to an English-speaker of our own day Newspeakwords were divided into three distinct classes, known asthe A vocabulary, the B vocabulary (also called compoundwords), and the C vocabulary. It will be simpler to discusseach class separately, but the grammatical peculiarities ofthe language can be dealt with in the section devoted to theA vocabulary, since the same rules held good for all threecategories.

THE A VOCABULARY. The A vocabulary consistedof the words needed for the business of everyday life—forsuch things as eating, drinking, working, putting on one'sclothes, going up and down stairs, riding in vehicles, garden-ing, cooking, and the like. It was composed almost entirelyof words that we already possess words like HIT, RUN,DOG, TREE, SUGAR, HOUSE, FIELD—but in compari-son with the present-day English vocabulary their numberwas extremely small, while their meanings were far morerigidly defined. All ambiguities and shades of meaning hadbeen purged out of them. So far as it could be achieved, aNewspeak word of this class was simply a staccato soundexpressing ONE clearly understood concept. It would havebeen quite impossible to use the A vocabulary for literarypurposes or for political or philosophical discussion. It wasintended only to express simple, purposive thoughts, usu-ally involving concrete objects or physical actions.

The grammar of Newspeak had two outstanding pe-culiarities. The first of these was an almost complete

378 1984

interchangeability between different parts of speech. Anyword in the language (in principle this applied even to veryabstract words such as IF or WHEN) could be used eitheras verb, noun, adjective, or adverb. Between the verb andthe noun form, when they were of the same root, there wasnever any variation, this rule of itself involving the de-struction of many archaic forms. The word THOUGHT,for example, did not exist in Newspeak. Its place was tak-en by THINK, which did duty for both noun and verb. Noetymological principle was followed here: in some cases itwas the original noun that was chosen for retention, in oth-er cases the verb. Even where a noun and verb of kindredmeaning were not etymologically connected, one or otherof them was frequently suppressed. There was, for example,no such word as CUT, its meaning being sufficiently cov-ered by the noun-verb KNIFE. Adjectives were formed byadding the suffix -FUL to the noun-verb, and adverbs byadding -WISE. Thus for example, SPEEDFUL meant 'rapid'and SPEEDWISE meant 'quickly. Certain of our present-day adjectives, such as GOOD, STRONG, BIG, BLACK,SOFT, were retained, but their total number was very small.There was little need for them, since almost any adjectivalmeaning could be arrived at by adding -FUL to a noun-verb.None of the now-existing adverbs was retained, except for avery few already ending in -WISE: the -WISE terminationwas invariable. The word WELL, for example, was replacedby GOODWISE.

In addition, any word—this again applied in principleto every word in the language—could be negatived by add-

Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com

ing the affix UN-, or could be strengthened by the affixPLUS-, or, for still greater emphasis, DOUBLEPLUS-. Thus,for example, UNCOLD meant 'warm', while PLUSCOLDand DOUBLEPLUSCOLD meant, respectively, 'very cold'and 'superlatively cold'. It was also possible, as in present-day English, to modify the meaning of almost any word byprepositional affixes such as ANTE-, POST-, UP-, DOWN-,etc. By such methods it was found possible to bring aboutan enormous diminution of vocabulary. Given, for instance,the word GOOD, there was no need for such a word as BAD,since the required meaning was equally well—indeed, bet-ter—expressed by UNGOOD. All that was necessary, inany case where two words formed a natural pair of oppo-sites, was to decide which of them to suppress. DARK, forexample, could be replaced by UNLIGHT, or LIGHT byUNDARK, according to preference.

The second distinguishing mark of Newspeak gram-mar was its regularity. Subject to a few exceptions whichare mentioned below all inflexions followed the same rules.Thus, in all verbs the preterite and the past participle werethe same and ended in -ED. The preterite of STEAL wasSTEALED, the preterite of THINK was THINKED, andso on throughout the language, all such forms as SWAM,GAVE, BROUGHT, SPOKE, TAKEN, etc., being abolished.All plurals were made by adding -S or -ES as the case mightbe. The plurals OF MAN, OX, LIFE, were MANS, OXES,LIFES. Comparison of adjectives was invariably made byadding -ER, -EST (GOOD, GOODER, GOODEST), ir-regular forms and the MORE, MOST formation being

380 1984

suppressed.

The only classes of words that were still allowed to inflectirregularly were the pronouns, the relatives, the demonstra-tive adjectives, and the auxiliary verbs. All of these followedtheir ancient usage, except that WHOM had been scrappedas unnecessary, and the SHALL, SHOULD tenses had beendropped, all their uses being covered by WILL and WOULD.There were also certain irregularities in word-formationarising out of the need for rapid and easy speech. A wordwhich was difficult to utter, or was liable to be incorrectlyheard, was held to be ipso facto a bad word; occasionallytherefore, for the sake of euphony, extra letters were insert-ed into a word or an archaic formation was retained. Butthis need made itself felt chiefly in connexion with the Bvocabulary. WHY so great an importance was attached toease of pronunciation will be made clear later in this essay.

THE B VOCABULARY. The B vocabulary consisted ofwords which had been deliberately constructed for politicalpurposes: words, that is to say, which not only had in everycase a political implication, but were intended to imposea desirable mental attitude upon the person using them.Without a full understanding of the principles of Ingsocit was difficult to use these words correctly. In some casesthey could be translated into Oldspeak, or even into wordstaken from the A vocabulary, but this usually demandeda long paraphrase and always involved the loss of certainovertones. The B words were a sort of verbal shorthand, of-ten packing whole ranges of ideas into a few syllables, andat the same time more accurate and forcible than ordinary

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 381

language.

The B words were in all cases compound words. [Com-pound words such as SPEAKWRITE, were of course to befound in the A vocabulary, but these were merely convenientabbreviations and had no special ideologcal colour.] Theyconsisted of two or more words, or portions of words, weld-ed together in an easily pronounceable form. The resultingamalgam was always a noun-verb, and inflected accordingto the ordinary rules. To take a single example: the wordGOODTHINK, meaning, very roughly, 'orthodoxy, or, ifone chose to regard it as a verb, 'to think in an orthodoxmanner'. This inflected as follows: noun-verb, GOOD-THINK; past tense and past participle, GOODTHINKED;present participle, GOOD-THINKING; adjective, GOOD-THINKFUL; adverb, GOODTHINKWISE; verbal noun,GOODTHINKER.

The B words were not constructed on any etymologicalplan. The words of which they were made up could be anyparts of speech, and could be placed in any order and muti-lated in any way which made them easy to pronounce whileindicating their derivation. In the word CRIMETHINK(thoughtcrime), for instance, the THINK came second,whereas in THINKPOL (Thought Police) it came first,and in the latter word POLICE had lost its second syllable.Because of the great difficulty in securing euphony, irregu-lar formations were commoner in the B vocabulary thanin the A vocabulary. For example, the adjective forms ofMINITRUE, MINIPAX, and MINILUV were, respectively,MINITRUTHFUL, MINIPEACEFUL, and MINILOVELY,

382 1984

simply because -TRUEFUL, -PAXFUL, and -LOVEFULwere slightly awkward to pronounce. In principle, however,all B words could inflect, and all inflected in exactly thesame way.

Some of the B words had highly subtilized meanings,barely intelligible to anyone who had not mastered thelanguage as a whole. Consider, for example, such a typicalsentence from a 'Times' leading article as OLDTHINKERSUNBELLYFEEL INGSOC. The shortest rendering that onecould make of this in Oldspeak would be: 'Those whoseideas were formed before the Revolution cannot have a fullemotional understanding of the principles of English So-cialism.' But this is not an adequate translation. To beginwith, in order to grasp the full meaning of the Newspeaksentence quoted above, one would have to have a clear ideaof what is meant by INGSOC. And in addition, only a per-son thoroughly grounded in Ingsoc could appreciate thefull force of the word BELLYFEEL, which implied a blind,enthusiastic acceptance difficult to imagine today; or of theword OLDTHINK, which was inextricably mixed up withthe idea of wickedness and decadence. But the special func-tion of certain Newspeak words, of which OLDTHINKwas one, was not so much to express meanings as to de-stroy them. These words, necessarily few in number, hadhad their meanings extended until they contained withinthemselves whole batteries of words which, as they weresufficiently covered by a single comprehensive term, couldnow be scrapped and forgotten. The greatest difficulty fac-ing the compilers of the Newspeak Dictionary was not to

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 383

invent new words, but, having invented them, to make surewhat they meant: to make sure, that is to say, what ranges ofwords they cancelled by their existence.

As we have already seen in the case of the word FREE,words which had once borne a heretical meaning weresometimes retained for the sake of convenience, but onlywith the undesirable meanings purged out of them. Count-less other words such as HONOUR, JUSTICE, MORALITY,INTERNATIONALISM, DEMOCRACY, SCIENCE, andRELIGION had simply ceased to exist. A few blanket wordscovered them, and, in covering them, abolished them. Allwords grouping themselves round the concepts of liber-ty and equality, for instance, were contained in the singleword CRIMETHINK, while all words grouping themselvesround the concepts of objectivity and rationalism werecontained in the single word OLDTHINK. Greater preci-sion would have been dangerous. What was required in aParty member was an outlook similar to that of the ancientHebrew who knew, without knowing much else, that all na-tions other than his own worshipped 'false gods'. He didnot need to know that these gods were called Baal, Osiris,Moloch, Ashtaroth, and the like: probably the less he knewabout them the better for his orthodoxy. He knew Jehovahand the commandments of Jehovah: he knew, therefore,that all gods with other names or other attributes were falsegods. In somewhat the same way, the party member knewwhat constituted right conduct, and in exceedingly vague,generalized terms he knew what kinds of departure fromit were possible. His sexual life, for example, was entirely

384 1984

regulated by the two Newspeak words SEXCRIME (sex-ual immorality) and GOODSEX (chastity). SEXCRIMEcovered all sexual misdeeds whatever. It covered fornica-tion, adultery, homosexuality, and other perversions, and,in addition, normal intercourse practised for its own sake.There was no need to enumerate them separately, since theywere all equally culpable, and, in principle, all punishableby death. In the C vocabulary, which consisted of scientificand technical words, it might be necessary to give special-ized names to certain sexual aberrations, but the ordinarycitizen had no need of them. He knew what was meant byGOODSEX—that is to say, normal intercourse betweenman and wife, for the sole purpose of begetting children,and without physical pleasure on the part of the woman: allelse was SEXCRIME. In Newspeak it was seldom possible tofollow a heretical thought further than the perception thatit WAS heretical: beyond that point the necessary wordswere nonexistent.

No word in the B vocabulary was ideologically neutral.A great many were euphemisms. Such words, for instance,as JOYCAMP (forced-labour camp) or MINIPAX Minis-try of Peace, i.e. Ministry of War) meant almost the exactopposite of what they appeared to mean. Some words, onthe other hand, displayed a frank and contemptuous un-derstanding of the real nature of Oceanic society. Anexample was PROLEFEED, meaning the rubbishy enter-tainment and spurious news which the Party handed outto the masses. Other words, again, were ambivalent, hav-ing the connotation 'good' when applied to the Party and

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 385

'bad' when applied to its enemies. But in addition there weregreat numbers of words which at first sight appeared to bemere abbreviations and which derived their ideological co-lour not from their meaning, but from their structure.

So far as it could be contrived, everything that had ormight have political significance of any kind was fitted intothe B vocabulary. The name of every organization, or bodyof people, or doctrine, or country, or institution, or publicbuilding, was invariably cut down into the familiar shape;that is, a single easily pronounced word with the smallestnumber of syllables that would preserve the original deri-vation. In the Ministry of Truth, for example, the RecordsDepartment, in which Winston Smith worked, was calledRECDEP, the Fiction Department was called FICDEP, theTeleprogrammes Department was called TELEDEP, and soon. This was not done solely with the object of saving time.Even in the early decades of the twentieth century, tele-scoped words and phrases had been one of the characteristicfeatures of political language; and it had been noticed thatthe tendency to use abbreviations of this kind was mostmarked in totalitarian countries and totalitarian organi-zations. Examples were such words as NAZI, GESTAPO,COMINTERN, INPRECORR, AGITPROP. In the begin-ning the practice had been adopted as it were instinctively,but in Newspeak it was used with a conscious purpose. Itwas perceived that in thus abbreviating a name one nar-rowed and subtly altered its meaning, by cutting out most ofthe associations that would otherwise cling to it. The wordsCOMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL, for instance, call up

386 1984

a composite picture of universal human brotherhood, redflags, barricades, Karl Marx, and the Paris Commune. Theword COMINTERN, on the other hand, suggests merely atightly-knit organization and a well-defined body of doc-trine. It refers to something almost as easily recognized,and as limited in purpose, as a chair or a table. COMIN-TERN is a word that can be uttered almost without takingthought, whereas COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL isa phrase over which one is obliged to linger at least mo-mentarily. In the same way, the associations called up by aword like MINITRUE are fewer and more controllable thanthose called up by MINISTRY OF TRUTH. This accountednot only for the habit of abbreviating whenever possible, butalso for the almost exaggerated care that was taken to makeevery word easily pronounceable.

In Newspeak, euphony outweighed every considerationother than exactitude of meaning. Regularity of grammarwas always sacrificed to it when it seemed necessary. Andrightly so, since what was required, above all for politicalpurposes, was short clipped words of unmistakable mean-ing which could be uttered rapidly and which roused theminimum of echoes in the speaker's mind. The words of theB vocabulary even gained in force from the fact that nearlyall of them were very much alike. Almost invariably thesewords—GOODTHINK, MINIPAX, PROLEFEED, SEX-CRIME, JOYCAMP, INGSOC, BELLYFEEL, THINKPOL,and countless others—were words of two or three syllables,with the stress distributed equally between the first syllableand the last. The use of them encouraged a gabbling style of

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 387

speech, at once staccato and monotonous. And this was ex-actly what was aimed at. The intention was to make speech,and especially speech on any subject not ideologically neu-tral, as nearly as possible independent of consciousness. Forthe purposes of everyday life it was no doubt necessary, orsometimes necessary, to reflect before speaking, but a Partymember called upon to make a political or ethical judge-ment should be able to spray forth the correct opinions asautomatically as a machine gun spraying forth bullets. Histraining fitted him to do this, the language gave him an al-most foolproof instrument, and the texture of the words,with their harsh sound and a certain wilful ugliness whichwas in accord with the spirit of Ingsoc, assisted the processstill further.

So did the fact of having very few words to choose from.Relative to our own, the Newspeak vocabulary was tiny,and new ways of reducing it were constantly being devised.Newspeak, indeed, differed from most all other languagesin that its vocabulary grew smaller instead of larger everyyear. Each reduction was a gain, since the smaller the areaof choice, the smaller the temptation to take thought. Ulti-mately it was hoped to make articulate speech issue fromthe larynx without involving the higher brain centres atall. This aim was frankly admitted in the Newspeak wordDUCKSPEAK, meaning 'to quack like a duck'. Like variousother words in the B vocabulary, DUCKSPEAK was ambiv-alent in meaning. Provided that the opinions which werequacked out were orthodox ones, it implied nothing butpraise, and when 'The Times' referred to one of the orators

1984

of the Party as a DOUBLEPLUSGOOD DUCKSPEAKER itwas paying a warm and valued compliment.

THE C VOCABULARY. The C vocabulary was supple-mentary to the others and consisted entirely of scientificand technical terms. These resembled the scientific termsin use today, and were constructed from the same roots, butthe usual care was taken to define them rigidly and stripthem of undesirable meanings. They followed the samegrammatical rules as the words in the other two vocabu-laries. Very few of the C words had any currency either ineveryday speech or in political speech. Any scientific work-er or technician could find all the words he needed in thelist devoted to his own speciality, but he seldom had morethan a smattering of the words occurring in the other lists.Only a very few words were common to all lists, and therewas no vocabulary expressing the function of Science as ahabit of mind, or a method of thought, irrespective of itsparticular branches. There was, indeed, no word for 'Sci-ence', any meaning that it could possibly bear being alreadysufficiently covered by the word INGSOC.

From the foregoing account it will be seen that in New-speak the expression of unorthodox opinions, above a verylow level, was well-nigh impossible. It was of course pos-sible to utter heresies of a very crude kind, a species ofblasphemy. It would have been possible, for example, to sayBIG BROTHER IS UNGOOD. But this statement, whichto an orthodox ear merely conveyed a self-evident absur-dity, could not have been sustained by reasoned argument,because the necessary words were not available. Ideas inim-

FreeeBooksatPlaneteBook.com 389

ical to Ingsoc could only be entertained in a vague wordlessform, and could only be named in very broad terms whichlumped together and condemned whole groups of heresieswithout defining them in doing so. One could, in fact, onlyuse Newspeak for unorthodox purposes by illegitimatelytranslating some of the words back into Oldspeak. For ex-ample, ALL MANS ARE EQUAL was a possible Newspeaksentence, but only in the same sense in which ALL MENARE REDHAIRED is a possible Oldspeak sentence. It didnot contain a grammatical error, but it expressed a palpa-ble untruth—i.e. that all men are of equal size, weight, orstrength. The concept of political equality no longer existed,and this secondary meaning had accordingly been purgedout of the word EQUAL. In 1984, when Oldspeak was stillthe normal means of communication, the danger theo-retically existed that in using Newspeak words one mightremember their original meanings. In practice it was notdifficult for any person well grounded in DOUBLETHINKto avoid doing this, but within a couple of generations eventhe possibility of such a lapse would have vaished. A per-son growing up with Newspeak as his sole language wouldno more know that EQUAL had once had the second-ary meaning of 'politically equal', or that FREE had oncemeant 'intellectually free', than for instance, a person whohad never heard of chess would be aware of the secondarymeanings attaching to QUEEN and ROOK. There wouldbe many crimes and errors which it would be beyond hispower to commit, simply because they were nameless andtherefore unimaginable. And it was to be foreseen that with

1984

the passage of time the distinguishing characteristics ofNewspeak would become more and more pronounced—itswords growing fewer and fewer, their meanings more andmore rigid, and the chance of putting them to improperuses always diminishing.

When Oldspeak had been once and for all superseded,the last link with the past would have been severed. Historyhad already been rewritten, but fragments of the literatureof the past survived here and there, imperfectly censored,and so long as one retained one's knowledge of Oldspeakit was possible to read them. In the future such fragments,even if they chanced to survive, would be unintelligibleand untranslatable. It was impossible to translate any pas-sage of Oldspeak into Newspeak unless it either referred tosome technical process or some very simple everyday ac-tion, or was already orthodox (GOODTHINKFUL wouldbe the Newspeak expression) in tendency. In practice thismeant that no book written before approximately 1960could be translated as a whole. Pre-revolutionary literaturecould only be subjected to ideological translation—that is,alteration in sense as well as language. Take for examplethe well-known passage from the Declaration of Indepen-dence:

WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT,THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL, THAT THEYARE ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH CERTAININALIENABLE RIGHTS, THAT AMONG THESE ARELIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS.

Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 391

THAT TO SECURE THESE RIGHTS, GOVERNMENTS AREINSTITUTED AMONG MEN, DERIVING THEIR POWERSFROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED. THATWHENEVER ANY FORM OF GOVERNMENT BECOMESDESTRUCTIVE OF THOSE ENDS, IT IS THE RIGHT OF THEPEOPLE WALTER OR ABOLISH IT, AND TO INSTITUTENEW GOVERNMENT...

It would have been quite impossible to render this intoNewspeak while keeping to the sense of the original. Thenearest one could come to doing so would be to swallow thewhole passage up in the single word CRIMETHINK. A fulltranslation could only be an ideological translation, where-by Jefferson's words would be changed into a panegyric onabsolute government.

A good deal of the literature of the past was, indeed, al-ready being transformed in this way. Considerations ofprestige made it desirable to preserve the memory of cer-tain historical figures, while at the same time bringingtheir achievements into line with the philosophy of Ingsoc.Various writers, such as Shakespeare, Milton, Swift, By-ron, Dickens, and some others were therefore in process oftranslation: when the task had been completed, their orig-inal writings, with all else that survived of the literatureof the past, would be destroyed. These translations werea slow and difficult business, and it was not expected thatthey would be finished before the first or second decade ofthe twenty-first century. There were also large quantities ofmerely utilitarian literature—indispensable technical man-

1984

uals, and the like—that had to be treated in the same way. Itwas chiefly in order to allow time for the preliminary workof translation that the final adoption of Newspeak had beenfixed for so late a date as 2050.

The year 2028. Mankind is in the stranglehold of aworldwide surveillance state. Frank Kohlhaas, a pettycitizen, lives a cheerless life, working as an agency workerin a steel plant.

One day, he gets into a conflict with the tyrannical system,because of an unfortunate accident. An automated trailconvicts him to five years of imprisonment and Frankdisappears in a detention centre, where he suffers under acruel system of brainwashing and reeducation.After eight months of pain, the authorities decide to transferhim to another prison. On the way there, somethingunexpected happens. Suddenly everything changes and theyoung man finds himself caught between the fronts...

Foreword

This is the English version of the first book of Alexander

Merow's "Prey World" series. The novel was translated by

Thorsten Weber - and the whole procedure entailed a lot of

work. But it was also really funny.

It is not a professional translation and the translator is not a

"native speaker" or English teacher. He is just a guy who

loves science-fiction and dystopias. So try not to laugh at

some of the translated phrases, or the wrath of a real freak

will come over you!

Nevertheless, we thought that would be a good idea to

translate this interesting, courageous and critical novel into

the English language. At the same time it will also enable

English speaking people to join Alexander Merow's growing

audience.

"Prey World" is neither an ordinary book nor light

entertainment. There is already plenty of "light

entertainment" in our times - far too much. On the other

hand, there are not enough books like "Prey World". Books

that make you think about the world we live in. And it is

important that people begin to think.

The author has already found numerous interested readers

all over Germany, and we hope, he will find additional

readers in the English-speaking countries. We would also

be glad, if a "real" mother-tongue speaker were to edit this

English version one day.

Some readers compare "Prey World" with George Orweirs

"1984", the classic among the dystopic novels. Others see

elements of Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451" in it.

However, critical thinkers and friends of so called

"conspiracy theories" will have their fun with "Prey World". Is

Alexander Merow's vision of the future really realistic at all?A worldwide surveillance state? A World Government underthe control of a ruthless secret society? We will see!

And always remember...

"Only a fool would think that "Prey World" is nothingbut fiction!" (Alexander Merow)

Have fun!

"Maybe it is nothing but madness and suicide. Maybe it willnot change the world, but this is not important for me.Nevertheless, it will change something for me!I have suffered too much to humble myself anymore. Theyhave told us to humble ourselves - since the kindergarten.Shut up! Consume! Obey! Endure! Believe everything!Watch shit! Buy shit! Eat shit! Turn the other cheek!What has become of us? Why have we become sheep?Why do we endure this all without doing something? Whyhas nobody the guts to act?

Thorsten's books were a real eye-opener to me! Now, Iknow who they are and what they plan for us all. And I can'tforget what they have done to me. They call us "cattle".Okay, then I will be the black sheep in the flock. And theblack sheep will fight back now! And it does not fear thebutcher anymore, because even a butcher can be killed.Franky, the little black sheep, will make them pay now! AndI hope that the flock of white sheep will wake up some day."

Diary entry of Frank Kohlhaas, 17.02.2029

Citizen 1-564398B-278843

Frank Kohlhaas, who was called citizen 1-564398B-278843in his everyday life, because this was his officialadministrative code, was already dreaming of theunpleasant smell in the hall of his flat, reminding him ofrotten eggs. In his mind, shortly before 5.00 o'clock in themorning - soon the dream would be terminated by thealarm - Frank was on a walk through a sunny valley. Buteven at this beautiful place, the moldy smell was stillpervasive, so that Frank wondered, how such a beautifulvalley could smell so repulsive.

When the alarm-clock rang, it quickly became clear that thesunny valley was just fantasy, although the smell was real.The noise was shrill and Frank awoke swearing. Now hehad to get up, put on his clothes, have a hasty breakfastand walk to the production complex 42-B.„Damn!", hissed the unshaven man as he moved his notexcessively tall, but amazingly strong body from his cheaplyproduced bed.

„Hmmmhaaa!", yawned Frank, shuffling through his still darkapartment to the next room, where a dirty kitchen waswaiting for him. The citizen tore open the refrigerator doorand chocked down a cheese sandwich, the meager left-overs from yesterday's supper.

The water kettle was started with a loud whoosh and, after afew minustes, supplied hot water for a cup of instant coffee.„Nnnhhaa!", uttered the young man, a statement, that couldbe interpreted in many ways at this early hour, and couldhave referred to his life situation in general. At 5.27 o'clock,Frank closed the battered door behind himself and walkedlistlessly down the dark corridor on his way to descend the

even darker stairway. The source of that foul stench, that

had been torturing Frank's nose for days, was somewhere

here. Perhaps one of the other tenants, damn idiot, had left

his garbage in the corridor.

J don't know...", he muttered.

Each morning it was the same old story: „Rising, eating,

walking, slogging away...", as Kohlhaas always said.

In the past years, he had learned to hate his life. He was 25

years old now, living in a more than shabby flat on the

outskirts of the former FRG capital, Berlin, working for

modest wages as a temporary help in a steel plant. In

former times, he had wanted to study, but this issue was

over - for reasons that Frank never mentioned.

Actually, he was not dumb, but, according to his own words,

he couldn't hack it yet. However, the job at the steel plant

was better than nothing, because it gave him the chance to

earn some money and to survive - an advantage that was

not enjoyed by millions of Germans in the year 2027.

As he now groped along again on this particular morning,

step by step towards the plant, he passed demolished

houses in the twilight and crowds of homeless people lying

in masses in the dark corners of the streets.

„What would be, if I simply didn't care about the

consequences and went home again, got back into my bed

and just slept until tomorrow?", he thought sometimes.

„What would it be like if I just packed my bags and

disappeared from this rotten city, this scruffy country?", he

asked himself occasionally.

But where was it any different? He should enjoy, what he

had - he'd got a job and didn't go hungry. That was at least

something, thought Frank.

After the worker had gone through a very long and dark

underpass without giving a Globe coin to the drunken

beggar there, the production complex came into Frank's

vision. It was 5.53 in the morning and the workers for theearly shift stood there waiting, smoking, jawing.When the factory gates finally opened at 6 o'clock, about200 workers poured through them like a viscous mash. Mostof them were not in any rush to begin their work, but it hadto be, there was no other way."No alternative!", as Frank always said.After ten hours, they went back home again. All were dirtyand tired, but happy that the work was over for the day.Frank crept through the corridor on his floor, which was stilldim even by day, and unlocked the door of his apartment.There were no new messages on the Scanchip and thatwas good, because it were usually only calculations:electricity, water and such things. Frank had placed thetelevision in his bedroom the day before, so if he couldn'tfall asleep, he could turn it on. The program did not interesthim, but with the sound of anyone talking, he didn't feel soalone in this dark block of flats.

Kohlhaas just knew his neighbours from brief encounters.Many of them only left their apartments to go to work andsome of them had become serious boozers in recent years.From time to time someone would bawl from his balcony oraccosted people, passing "his block" - but after a while,everyone was sleeping.

Citizen 1-564398B-278843 watched television till 22.37o'clock: the news („War of the global armed forces againstdangerous terrorists in Iran"), talk shows, easyentertainment on all fronts, warnings of the second dog fluepidemic and the necessity for the immediate compulsoryinoculation. Then he fell asleep, although meanwhile thefoul smell from outside seemed to have lodged itself in hispillow....

Next day...

10

„Good morning, Frank!", muttered Dirk Weber, one of theforemen. „Good morning, Dirk!", answered Frank listlessly. Itwas 6.03 o'clock, the morning shift began. A-341, this wasthe designation of the young man as worker and temporaryhelp in the steel plant, gave his helping hands for manyoperational steps till the clock indicated 10.30.Now it was time for a short lunch, and when Frankunwraped his only bun which was covered with a piece ofsalami, he did not suspect, that an unpleasant stroke of fatewould wait for him in the following minutes.Since approximately half a year, the production complex'administration had arranged the singing of the "One-World-Song", due to a new international regulation, before everylunch time in each production complex - for the increase ofwork moral and to strengthen the international doctrine of„peace, freedom, prosperity and equality" that waspropagated by the World Government since 2018. Theofficial of the "Ministry for Production Supervision", stationedin this enterprise, Mr. Gert Sasse, who was mostly in hisoffice above the factory building, had conscientiously comedown to the workers to sing the "One-World-Song" withthem. It was always the same.

..Workers, now is lunch time! But we will sing first!", heshouted through the hall and the steel workers formed to abored line, in order to enjoy the short break after thesinging:

"We are the children of One-World and we are all equal!

We love our One-World, the great realm of peace!

We don't know any classes, we don't know any races..."

Frank heard ever more rarely on the text in the last weeks,didn't move his lips and stared at the ceiling of the dirtyproduction hall. ..Hurry up!", he thought and boredly scraped

11

with his left foot over the dusty ground. Then the singing

was over.

„Gosh! This stupid song is really getting on my nerves!",

said the labourer very quietly to himself.

„AH right, men! That could be done - halfway! Enjoy your

meal!", called the official of the "Ministry for Production

Supervision" and A-341 looked forward to a hungry bite in

his softened roll.

But while his teeth eagerly crushed the salty piece of

salami, he was hit by an angry look of Mr. Sasse. The

supervisor narrowed his eyes to slits and looked like an

aggressive bulldog.

„A-341! Yes, you! Come to me! Hurry!", he roared at the top

of his lungs.

This got Frank's adrenalin flowing. He didn't need quarrel at

work anymore.

„Come on, A-341!", yelled Mr. Sasse, waving the worker

nearer. Kohlhaas followed the order immediately.

„l am just a fool for you, isn't it?", hissed the man.

„Eh...no! Of course not, Sir...eh...Mr. Sasse!", stammered

Frank.

J fail to see what you mean...", he added stumbling.

„How I mean this, you idiot?", screamed the official with a

look which gave the young man the biggest possible

uneasiness. A malicious silence prevailed for several

oppressive seconds. Meanwhile, the eyes of the superior

threateningly became smaller and bushy, black eyebrows

were pushed over them.

A second later, Frank saw a fist with fatty fingers fly towards

his face. It suddenly hurt and his nasal bone reacted with a

cracking on the punch. While some blood threads flowed

down from his nose, A-341 heard a growl: „How I mean that,

you numbskull?"

„lf I give the instruction that the „One-World-Song" has to be

sung, you have to sing it too. This was an order!",

completed Mr. Sasse his powerful argument.

His intonation varied now between satisfaction and

rampantly growing meanness. In the meantime, Kohlhaas

had gone to the ground. This punch had been really hard

and Sasse gave him another kick in the ribs now.

„Do you understand, idiot? You probably think, that you

have a special status here, isn't it?", he roared.

The other workers googled at him and hid their faces behind

their rolls. Meanwhile, Kohlhaas felt like a kicked dog,

humiliated in front of the rest of his colleagues - what was

very close to reality. Without considering his action, he

jumped up and positioned himself in front of the official of

the "Ministry for Production Supervision".

"You can be glad, that you are my superior, otherwise I

would break you every bone!", screamed Frank with boiling

fury. Gert Sasse was baffled. A-341 obstinately wiped off

the blood from his lip.

One hour later, the worker still waited in front of the door ofthe production complex leader. Sasse was in his office andFrank heard him swearing and ranting. This was no goodsign.

„A-341, come in!", resounded the voice of the highest bossof this work plant over the brightly illuminated corridor. Theyoung man started moving and took a seat on the chair inthe middle of the office room. A short silence followed, thenit began.

J took a look on your Scanchip, A-341!", reported Mr.Reimers, the production complex leader. „ln the ten years ofyour activity here, you had come too late three times. Apartfrom that, this is not the first time that you make a spectacle

13

of yourself. You are already occured to me, because ofsubversive statements at work which can probably also beconfirmed by your colleagues. We have even marked youwith a blue code 67-Beta, if you didn't know it yet, A-341!We will examine the video tapes of your working days in thiscomplex in the next days, with our new "Voice-Analysis-System", and Tim sure that we will find some moresubversive statements.

But what you have done today, is a real scandal!Threatening an official of the highest authority of productionsupervision. Is there just air in your head, boy? If I don'ttake drastic measures in a case like this, my superiors willmake me a lot of problems.

I must dismiss you, A-341! Further, I am correctly obligated,to react on such an unbelievable incident with a message tothe responsible administration. Disappear now from thisproduction complex, and never come back, A-341!"Frank Kohlhaas, the just dismissed worker, was struckdumb with horror. His vocal chords seemed to be rusted, histhroat was tied and his courage was put on ice somewhere.He went out, just went out, pale as death, with a roaringhead, without answering. Frank had lost his job, his sourcefor subsistence. And this was no fun in these joyless days.

Like in trance, the young man went into the changing roomof the production complex and absently opened the baggysheet door of his spint. ..Dismissal" - this word sounded likethe cut of a razor in the ear of each listener in this time. Itwas related to the word ..liquidation", because it was thedestruction of the social existence. Being dismissed meantto get no more Globes, as the international currency wascalled since the year 2018. If Frank would not find a newemployment as soon as possible, he could lose hisapartment, his food and finally also his life. Any social

14

security, warranted by the state, had completely beenabolished since the total collapse of world economy inwinter 2012/13. And it was more than difficult, to find work ina time, in which the industrial production in old Central andWestern Europe had mostly been outsourced to the ThirdWorld. Therefore, millions of Europeans tried to survive bydoing extremly bad paid jobs in this dark present. They hadnothing to lose, so they were glad about every breadlinewage they could get. Those, who were not able to find apossibility to earn some money in any way, ended asbeggars and homeless people, hanging around underbridges or in vacant house ruins.

On the next day, Frank was not awaked by the shrill sound

of his alarm, after an sorrowful and restless night, but by the

disgusting stench which came from the stairway. The smell

had not been liquidated by anyone - against the spirit of the

age.

Only in the early morning hours, he had been able to sleep

for a while, because of his constant brooding and the

unpleasant thoughts that had tortured him during the night.

As first thought of the new grey day, the face of Mr. Sasse

appeared in his head and the face of citizen 1-564398B-

278843 changed to a hateful grimace, when he mused

about killing the official with an iron rod.

„This damn hybrid! If my life goes down the drain, because

of that guy, then I will smash the skull of this bastard before

I go to hell!", hissed Frank, erupting in anger.

He finally crept out of his bed and stared down at the dirty

street in front of his apartement block.

„Damn! What shall I do now?", he thought. J must find a

new job, otherwise they will close the account on my

Scanchip, because I can't pay the fucking calculations any

longer."

15

After a further hour of useless musing, he left his dwelling,

tried not to inhale too deeply on the corridor, and walked the

dark stairs down to the ground floor.

The elevator was defective since months and nobody

seemed to waste a thought about repairing it. The only one,

Frank could imagine as a potential employer in this

hardship, was Stefan Meise, the junkdealer, an old

schoolmate.

Meise's scrapyard was about half an hour foot march

distant from Frank's apartment block. He hit the road,

walked down the ugly street, which was covered with

garbage, and finally reached his goal - a place full of rusty

cars and all kinds of metal debris.

Nevertheless, Stefan Meise was not difficult to find between

the mountains of scrap iron. He was very tall, thick, bearded

and looked hardly differed from what he collected and sold.

„Hello Stefan! How are you?", welcomed him Frank quietly,

trying to smile.

„Oh, Frank Kohlhaas! What's up, man?", answered the thick

junkdealer. "You haven't been here for ages!"

"I just thought, I could visit you. Does the scrap metal trade

still run, Stefan?", asked Frank. „You have here... eh... a lot

of rusty stuff...Where do you find so much junk?"

„Ha! I collect, what I can find. As all junkdealers do. Why do

you ask me this, Frank? Can I help you?", returned Meise.

„l have lost my job yesterday", told Frank, while the fat man

looked at him quizzically. Then, Meise stroke with his oily,

broad fingers over his dirty black overall.

.That's a disaster, Frank! And now?", asked Stefan and

shook his head.

„Now, I'm looking for something new. Some kind of

temporary job, you know? Perhaps, you still need another

helping hand?", murmured the young man.

16

For half a minute, Meise just googled at the unemployed

man with his yellowish, bulging eyes. Then he looked

around and tried to give his unpleasant answer as carefully

as possible.

..Working for me?", he inquired. ..Thus, Frank, the situation

is...eh...the times are bad. We all know this, my friend. I

almost run everything alone here and only Ralf helps me

from time to time. This is actually enough. I don't need a

second man, sorry!"

Frank Kohlhaas had never been a good actor and who saw

him now, could feel his disappointment.

„And only for two months?", he asked.

„l need none here, and I can't afford a second man, Frank!",

explained the thick, filthy man and turned away. „l'm sorry,

but I have to do some work now. No offense, but there is no

chance for you to find work here."

Back home, Frank hissed one of his worst curses and

kicked against the kitchen table. He desperately scanned

his brain for other possibilities of employment and checked

all production complexes around Berlin in his mind. But the

problem was, that his boss had given him a negative entry

in his Scanchip register after the conflict with Mr. Sasse,

what made it difficult to get a job in another steel plant.

He still had 246 Globes on his electronic account for this

month. More than 400 Globes he had to pay only for his

apartment in this rotted estate of prefabricated houses.

Time pressed now, with each day a little bit more, and the

dark shadow of despair grew with the passing hours. It

occupied Frank's mind like a malicious ulcer.

After the young man had watched an extremely stupid

sitcom, he switched off the television and tried to sleep. But

it was only 23,00 o'clock and regrettably the exhaustion had

not achieved the necessary level yet, to turn off Frank's

brain and give him some peace of mind.

17

Several hours followed, when Frank was staring at the darkceiling, cursing the production complex 42-B with all itssuperiors, supervisors and workers.

Then the stench from the hall became noticeable to himagain and the fog of despair in his head swelled so stronglythat the young man thought about killing himself.He mused about operating the bad thoughts and concernsunder his skullcap with a heavy-calibered shotgun whichwould completely spread his brain over the yellowedwallpaper behind his bedstead. And Frank Kohlhaas stillthought about many other things in this terrible night.He brooded over his so far senseless life, the isolation, themonotonousness and the gaping abyss that waited for himnow. Frank came to no solution in this night and not eventhe smallest glimmer of hope seemed to shine somewhere.Nothing. Outside it was dark. In front of the house, Frankcould recognize a few ripped garbage bags, which alreadylay there since several weeks. Then he was finally so tired,that he fell asleep with his head on the window sill.

Up to the end of the week, the search for a new job wasunsuccessful - as he had already expected it. It seemedthat there was no more work at all, in the periphery ofseveral kilometers. Furthermore, a inquiry at the localadministration had proven that Frank had meanwhile anegative entry in his Scanchip register, because of..disturbance of peace at the workplace"...Perhaps, the idea with the shotgun is not too bad at all! Butbefore that, I will visit this Sasse!", grumbled Frank onFriday, when the short weekend for his former colleagues ofthe production complex 42-B began.On Saturday and Sunday, he invested his last Globes in thecheap liquor from the kiosk at the corner. Alone in his small,modestly furnished apartment, in the dark block of flats, in a

18

much darker time. His fate and his pain was not noticed by

anyone else. Just like Frank Kohlhaas had never noticed

the pain of the others who lifed their lives in their

honeycombs, behind the shabby, gray walls of this

plattenbau.

If he would drink himself to death or blew his head away, he

would soon smell like the corridor on his floor, and it would

probably not even been noticed by his neighbors. This

thought was somehow so sick that it elecited Frank a

tormented smile.

Hard alcohol had not the best reputation, but one thing was

clear: It had already given millions of desperate people a

good sleep. No concern could be so big, that it couldn't be

drowned in a wave of the good and, above all, cheap booze

from the nearby kiosk. Frank checked this old truth in a

"self-experiment".

„Beep! Beep! Beep!", it resounded on Monday at 6.30

o'clock in the morning from the kitchen, where the drunk

man had forgotten his Scanchip. „Beep! Beep! Beep!"

An electronic woman's voice always repeated...

„Good morning, citizen 1-564398B-278843! You have amessage of priority level alpha on your Scanchip!"

„Good morning, citizen 1-564398B-278843! You have amessage of priority level alpha on your Scanchip!"

„Good morning, citizen 1-564398B-278843! You have amessage of priority level alpha on your Scanchip!"

„Hmmm...", hummed Frank, still a bit dazed from the nightbefore.

19

„Damn! What?", he muttered and rolled out of his bed which

still smelled of alcohol.

„What the hell? Damn! Shut up!", he grunted and walked

with a bad headache to the kitchen table.

It lasted a little eternity until Frank had remembered the pin

code and had found his way through the message-menu of

the Scanchip.

"What...?"

"Citation? What?", whispered citizen 1-564398B-278843. He

had to read it twice, in order to believe it. Did somebody try

to kid him?

„What the fuck is that?", he could only say.

Official citation:

Citizen 1-564398B-278843,

You are officially cited to an automated trial on14.08.2027 at 8.00 o'clock.

Official document code: 257789000-0100567-2345441113-EGN-59900-4/211Culprit number: 319444-556.77

20

Thank you for your cooperation!

Frank's atomised brain began to hurt and to rotate...Citation? What do you want from me?"He was totally confused and couldn't remember any crimesin his past life.

..Just because I've yelled at this damned Sasse?", hethought. ..This can't be true! I finally did not touch him. Ihave just lost control for some seconds. I don't understandthis. And what the hell do they mean with ..theoreticalaggravated battery"?"

And there was no doubt. Frank Kohlhaas, the helping outcitizen with the official code 1-564398B-278843, had neverdone something bad to another person. Except for the timein the kindergarten, back then, as he had given this stupidKevin a little slap and his parents had been called to theauthorithies. The local education officials had brieflybecome anxiously and had explanied that Frank would havesome ..subliminal aggressions" and a ..precarious masculinebehavior". Then they had suggested a therapy withtranquilizers.

But this was many years ago. Furthermore, the therapycould be avoided, after the child had repetend its "sins" infront of a committee of psychologists and socialpedagogues, and his parents had insured, that they wouldimmediately report Frank's next "crimes", if he wouldbecome noticeable again in this context.But he never became noticeable again. He always stuck tothe rules until this day; in the kindergarten, the elementaryschool and everywhere else. Since his fifth year of life, hehad always been a good boy. No, he was not noticeable atall. And of course he was no human being with ..subliminalaggressions". Sometimes in his thoughts or dreams, he beatup a superior or an administrative coworker, but this was a

21

secret and Frank had never talked about his thought crimes.He was just "normal", as he meant.

Apart from this, it was also the first time that the otherwiseperfectly inconspicuous plattenbau-inhabitant FrankKohlhaas had come in contact with an ..automated trial". Thecitizen had already heard about this, once in the news,since it had been introduced by the World Governmentthree years ago. But the young man could not imagine, whatthis strange process really was. But why should a decentperson like Frank think about such things? He had neverbecome culpable and had nothing to do with criminality.Therefore, the accused had not the foggiest notion, whatwaited for him now and so he wasn't too much concernedabout this citation.

It was probably nothing but a pure formality, circumstances,which could be clarified. Frank had not hurt anybody andtherefore he also could not be condemned. The young manhad already lost his job, because of the so called"disturbation of peace at the workplace". There was noreason to be worried, thought Kohlhaas.Now the unemployed man absently hit the button ..VoicePresentation" so that the message was slowly read out by acomputer-animated woman's voice. This was also anovelty. The administration had introduced the "VoicePresentation" some years ago, because more and morecitizens of Berlin were illiterate, above all, the youngergeneration. So an important official message had always tobe available in read out form.

The rest of this day wasn't very spectacular and the"automated trail" was already tomorrow. ..Then I will have areason to rise", said Frank to himself and grinned cynically.Shortly afterwards, Kohlhaas tried to call his father to askhim for some money, but he didn't reach anybody during

22

the whole day. Nevertheless, there was some more liquor inthe kitchen. Frank decided to get royally drunk once again,and fell asleep at midnight. He almost forgot to set hisalarm-clock...

23

Automated Trial

Although it was August, this morning was very cold and

dark. Frank's neck hurt and he had another headache from

last night's drunkenness. The local juridical complex was

over one hour foot march distant from his apartment block,

but the citizen thought, that it could be a good idea to go

and get some, more or less, fresh air. In addition, he could

fight the aftereffects of his hangover.

He hastily gulped down some toast, swallowed the

dissolvable coffee and examined the label on the plastic can

of the coffee powder.

„Globe Food" was written on it and Frank could see a world

ball. Above the globe was a pyramid with an eye on its top.

At the bottom of the picture was the slogan: „Food for the

people!"

„Amusing symbol!", murmured Frank into his three-day

beard.

He had never noticed this logo before, although he only

bought his food in the cheap „Globe Food" supermarkets,

which dominated Berlin. Then the thought left his head

again, as fast as it had come.

The unusual cold weather let Frank shiver. A draft of freshair blew through the dark stairway and temporary flushedaway even the smell of bad eggs. In front of him, a neighborwalked down to the exit and Frank considered if he hadseen the face of this man ever before.The man said something sounding like "Hello!", butKohlhaas wasn't sure. The accused slowly walked forwardand was still dizzy. He briefly looked at the playground inthe yard and beheld some children who were screaming

24

with shrill voices in an incomprehensible language. Was itTurkish? Or Arabic?

When the clock indicated 7.43, he could already recognize

the outlines of the juridical complex from the distance. It was

a large red building with hundreds of windows and over 30

floors. Dozens of court cells were in front of it, one of them

was waiting for him. The chambers, in which people could

get their "automated trial", were made of a gray metal and

about four meters wide, as Frank guessed from his distant

view.

Three other citizens already stood before them, between

them were some police officers. Slowly he became nervous.

Perhaps this hearing was nevertheless more unpleasantly,

than he had imagined at first.

Now it was necessary to pass an electrical gate, which was

protected by a doorman in a small, brown house. The

official gave Frank a sign to come nearer.

„Come here!", he called.

The young man ran forward and positioned himself in front

of the entrance of the guardroom.

„Scanchip!", said the doorman, holding a laser scanner in

his hand. Wordlessly he pulled the Scanchip out of Frank's

hand, without looking at him, and said after a short „beep" of

his code reader: „Court cell 4/211! Hurry up! It is nearly 8.00

o'clock! If you come too late, it will be just more expensive

for you!"

Frank's heart started to pound faster. Fearfully, he started

to search the court cells, in order to find his number. The

other accused examined him with some brief looks.

„Row 4! Shit! I must hurry up...211...", lamented Frank,

becoming more and more nervous. Meanwhile, only two

minutes remained, till his hearing would start. He began to

25

run and with a racing heart and an increasing headache, he

correctly reached his court cell in time.

Gasping for breath, he was welcomed by an electronic

woman's voice: ..Welcome citizen 1-564398B-278843, to

your automated trail! Please enter your culprit number on

the display and press OK!"

Frank pulled the Scanchip out of his trouser pocket, opened

the message menu, and tried to enter his culprit number. A

rarely known panic attacked him now. He looked around,

gasping for breath again.

..Actually, I don't have to go in this damn metal box,

because I didn't do anything!", he whispered, but the door

was already open. Frank's hands became sweaty, while he

breathed louder.

In front of him, a weakly lit up metallic hole had opened

itself, which requested him to step forward now.

..Come in, citizen 1-564398B-278843! Your trial is already

running!", it resounded from a loudspeaker at the ceiling of

the halfdark chamber. Frank Kohlhaas knew that he had no

chance to refuse the order. It was nevertheless an official

instruction and there was never and in no case room for a

discussion or exception.

He made a step forward and his knees felt more weak with

each passing second. Then a screen flashed. The

"automated trial" against the theoretical delinquent Frank

Kohlhaas took its course.

In large and bright letters, the reproaches could be read onthe screen:

Accusations:

- Massive disturbation at the workplace

- Theoretical aggravated battery

26

Frank swallowed and let out a big gush of air. The terriblysounding woman's voice, as friendly as an unnoticed virus,began with some remarks. A detailed description of theprogression of events, the listing of witnesses and additional"sub-charges" followed, for example ..subversive statementsat work" - and some more.

For several minutes, the young man didn't say anything,and besides, nobody had asked him for his point of view,only the computer voice was talking, implementing andaccusing.

Frank's former colleagues, Schmidt, Adiguzel and Nyang,had confirmed the fact, that the young man had refused thesinging of the "One-World-Song" several times and hadeven described the text as "nonsens" on 02.04.2027.Production supervisor Sasse had added that the aggressivemimic and the use of "strong vocabulary" during theargument in the factory, would be an evidence for Frank'stendency of "unnecessary analyzing of absolutely justifiedinstructions" and "subliminal aggressions".The boss of the production complex had confirmed this too.Further details followed: legal regulations and regulationsfor extended and deeper instructions in the reference to thelist and redefinition of defaults - and more.

"You can be glad that you are my superior, otherwise Iwould break you every bone!"

The intention of striking the superior, was more than clearlyproven, in the eyes of the automated court. The differencebetween a (in such a way) formulated intention and anactually implemented act, was relatively small, according tothe modern understanding of law which was orientedtowards psychology and statistics. Further, the probability tocommit this act one day in reality, had also enormously

27

increased, because the intention had clearly beenformulated. (Compare: „BMI of calibration of actual,theoretical and probable behavior" from 02.10.2020,document code: V-LUN-36777192934457656-Z, (89)")

Frank googled at the screen like a stunned cow, which hadwalked against an electrical fence. He was not able to thinkthat fast, how this computer programme made him to apotential interference factor, a danger for the order of theworldwide system, basing on freedom and humanitarianism.After an hour, the lecture finally came to an end. Now a newmenu appeared on the screen. The woman's voice with theelectronic taste kindly read out the sentences, sounding likesudden frost in Frank's ears:

„lf you deny the charges, please click on NO!"

"If you admit the charges, please klick on YES!"

Citizen 1-564398B-278843 hesitated, perked his eyebrows

up and tried to arrange his thoughts.

„What is this shit? Tve done nothing wrong, nothing at all!

This whole crap is a bad joke!", yelled Frank through the

court cell. For a second, he thought about crushing this

damn screen with a kick.

„l will choose NO! I'm innocent! No! I click NO! No

question!", he screamed angrily.

The accused hammered on the keys in front of him and

selected NO. Now he had to wait. The computer hummed.

..Loading" could be seen on the screen in bright letters.

Frank felt relieved for a short moment.

„Now that fucking thing knows that I am innocent. I

expressed myself clearly: NO!", he said grimly. Then he

smiled, a bit exhausted, while the inner tension started to

28

die down. Shortly afterwards, he got the answer of theautomated court computer, with metallic sound and cruellycombined letters on the bright screen:

..Accused, you selected NO! This means, you deny thereproaches and assume our juridical system, led byhumanistic principles, not to consider these!Unfortunately, we must tell you that the selection of themenu option NO leads, in principle, to an increasedmeasure of punishment, because it shows theintransigence of the culprit..."

The court decision is loaded...

The young man paused, gaped at the screen and cursedquietly, while his mouth became an astonished, shockedhole. Frank Kohlhaas' understanding seemed to beblocked, briefly put on „standby". The data were too largeand too terrible, in order to be able to be processed by hisbrain. The biological computer under his skullcap justseemed to fall into chaos and started to collapse.Then the gleeful shining screen of court cell 4/211 struck inhis face with still more malice. The judgement wasannounced:

„Citizen 1-564398B-278843! You are condemned to 5

years of detention in a center for reeducation and

resocialization!

To the reason: In your case, the statistic probability for

theoretical aggravated battery is at 78,11%!

The statistic probability for prospective subversive

behavior is at 53.59% in your case! Moreover, the

selection of the menu option NO increases the penalty.

But you can be unconcerned. Meanwhile, there are

29

numerous governmental institutions, in which humanbeings like you can get modern theraphies on thehighest level of science, in order to begin a happy andadapted new life in our humanistic society! We thankyou for your understanding!"

Frank's eyes bored into the screen and his ears roared. Theelectronic woman's voice resounded in his head like theecho of an atomic explosion. It became a slimy worm, whichate its way through his pinna towards his brain.„5 years of detention?", stammered the man.Frank tried to explain himself, that his hearing had deceivedhim, but the cruel news were also in front of his eyes.Unfortunately, both senses could not err. He wascondemned. It was correct.

Still in a condition of shock, the accused hardly noticed,when the electronic lock engaged behind him, blocking thecourt cell automatically. The damnation had beenproclaimed and the trap had sprung. In the first minutes,Frank was much too perplex to be able to realize this. Thedespair in this early moment was far too big that it couldgive room to feelings like hate or rage.

For this procedure, 411.66 Globes were deducted fromFrank's Scanchip account, what was also mentioned by thecomputer voice.

He might behave and wait, until the police officers wouldcome to arrest him. Then he would be brought to a transportvehicle, as the computer explained. Citizen 1-564398B-278843 listened to these further instructions withoutshowing any emotions. The condition of torpidity was tooserious. Half an hour later, he suddenly jumped up in hisdespair, in order to cry. But a strange weakness had

30

captured his mind and after a short emotional outburst,Kohlhaas crept into a dark corner and waited...Perhaps it is just a misunderstanding? It could surely becleared up!", it temporarily flared up in his mind. "I must talkto the officials. They can...can help me, to find a solution.The computer must have erred."

When two policemen arrived at the court cell, about one

hour later, they already heard Frank complaing from a

distance.

J think, that is the loudest guy today!", sneered a

policeman.

"He has a real big mouth!", said the other.

The steel door of the dark court chamber opened and

offered a sorry sight to the policemen. But it was not a

picture, which was strange to them. Outbreaks of accused

people after automated trials, were nothing new for them.

They brought Frank to one of the vehicles...

31

Big eye

The transport to „Big Eye", one of the largest and most

modern high safety prisons in the entire administrative

sector ..Central Europe", did not last for a long time, but it

seemed to go on forever for Frank. Mentally absent, like hit

by an arrow full of narcotic poison, he stared vacantly into

space.

The police officers ignored him and talked most of the time

about a new TV show, called „The Little Whisperer", where

children could win prices if they uncovered "subversive

behavior" among their relatives or neighbors.

Actually, the young man had planned to address the police

officers, to tell them that everything was just a judicial error,

but he did not do it. And they did not seem to have any

interest to make some small talk with him.

After a while, the outlines of an enormous prison complex

appeared on the horizon. This was „Big Eye". Frank had

once seen a report on television about this institute, where

only happy and healed ..patients" (this was the official

designation) were shown to the people. Now he was on the

way there.

The building was surrounded by high concrete walls, which

were provided with barbed wire and watchtowers. It had

several floors and on an outside wall, the prisoner

recognized the strange symbol, he had already seen before

on the label of his coffee powder glass.

A pyramid with an eye on its top. The sign looked somehow

differently than the escutcheon of the "Globe Food" chain of

stores, but nevertheless, the similarity was clear. „Big Eye" -

the great eye. Nobody could escape from its view!", thought

Frank, driven by fear. He should be right.

32

The patient finally left the transporter and the officers did nothave to become rough this time. He followed them, wassilent and accepted all their instructions like being on drugs.Dress order, behavioral code, sleeping time. He hardlyheard on all the talk, musing about the rising nightmarearound him.

If he listened or not, was quite immaterial. He should remainhere for five long years, according to an official courtdecision, and had therefore time enough to internalize theroutine of the day to the smallest detail. After Frank hadundressed, he received a white shirt and white trousers, justas white trainers.

„You will get a new set every week!", explained one of theattendants. „Follow me now, citizen 1-564398B-278843!From now on, you are called "Patient 111-F-47" in thisinstitute! Do you understand this?" Frank answered with anod and followed the man.

„Now go with the execution officials, they will bring you toyour cell in block F. Don't make problems!"The new prisoner was lead many stairways up to one of thehighest floors of the prison complex. Internally broken, hestared at the ground, but even in his lethargic state ofshock, he noticed that nothing could be heard from the otherprisoners. No discussions, no crying or any other sound. Itwas oppressing. The long corridors of „Big Eye" wereuncanny quiet and all the numbered cell doors were madeof extremely thick steel. The cell with the number 47, inblock F, was provided for Frank. He tried to explain himself,that everything was nothing but a nightmare. It could not bereal and soon he would wake up, in order to enjoy thestench from his stairway at first. He would run out of hisapartment and loudly yell over the corridor: „Nice, that youare here, stench!"

Yes, he would do it, because this prison could only be acruel vision in the depths of his mind, and in the nextmoment this scenario would just split like an unpleasantthought. But it was not like that.

„111-F-47! Here we are! This is your cell!", one of theexecution officials suddenly said. The sturdy man with thebrown mustachio and the sharp-edged cheek bone enteredan access code and the cell door opened.„ln there, 111-F-47!", he grunted.

In this second, clarity returned to Frank's mind again. Theyoung man abruptly realized, that he would spend the nextfive years in this room. This let his sanity splinter like glass.He broke down and lost consciousness.

After an indefinite time, Frank came round again. Waked up

by a blazing neon light, which penetrated his lids. He was

still dazed, felt sick and the glow stabbed in his skull like a

sharp spear.

„Wake up, patient 111-F-47!", said a voice somewhere in

the room.

„Wake up, patient 111-F-47!", it resonated again. Frank

layed with his back on a light gray plank bed of pleather and

his headache returned with a vengeance.

„Wake up, patient 111-F-47!" Again and again and again.

The head of the young man hurt, as if somebody had put it

into a vice, he was hungry and felt tired and frail.

„l_eave me alone!", he begged and tried to turn away from

the sharp light, but it was impossible.

„Patient 111-F-47! Listen!", it resounded from the ceiling of

the cell.

Frank sat down on the edge of the plank bed and held the

hands over his eyes. „What do you want from me?", he

gasped.

34

..Welcome to your holo cell, patient 111-F-47! Don't bescared! You are in a mental hospital and we want to helpyou!", told the metallic woman's voice from the loudspeaker...This new holo cell is a part of your therapy, patient 111-F-47! We use these mechanisms here in „Big Eye", helpingyou to regain the path of the adapted citizen. In this holocell, all outlines just blur; it is unlimited, like our "One World",whose happy citizen you will be after your healing, patient111-F-47!

Trust us and our newest therapy. Developed byphilanthropists, in order to help people. This cell containsthe freedom, because it does not know borders. It is yourfreedom to heal yourself, the freedom of your mind whichwill learn with our help!"

Frank Kohlhaas still held his hurting head. This light wasintolerable and it should still last weeks, until he had gothalfway accustomed to its sharp brightness. Finally, heexamined his new home. The room had a size of perhapshundred square meters, maybe it was a bit smaller. Frankcould hardly see the outlines of the walls or the cell door,because of the bright, white light.

The glow was terrible and it penetrated his brain completely.Even if Frank screwed up his eyes, this unnatural brightnessbesieged his barricaded head persistently like an army.Frank's headache became stronger. Then he just vomitedon his plank bed and crept into a corner...Patient 111-F-47! Do you hear us? You are in a holo cell!Do you understand this? If so, then lift your hand!",demanded the loudspeaker energetically.The sick man signaled the fact that he had understood andstill huddled in the corner. In the cell were no things, onlythe plank bed and a toilet at the opposite wall. Otherwise,here was only the biting light.

35

„You will get one hour of reeducation, twice a day!",explained the unnatural voice from the upper corner of theroom. „The first reeducation hour begins in 30 minutes,patient 111 -F-47! Get ready!"

Frank was overtaxed with this situation and dug his face,still hiding in the corner, behind his knees. He tried to thinkabout nothing and would have done everything to switchthat light off. But this was not within his power. As nothing in„Big Eye" was within his power.

He was nothing but a white mouse here, a small laboratoryrat in a cage, that had to endure everything the sadisticinventors of this so called „mental hospital" had invented.Shortly afterwards, the reeducation hour began, wherebythe loudspeaker intensively explained 111-F-47 the reasonsfor his „therapy" again. It said, that they wanted to make a„good human being" of Frank. „A human being, which ishuman, by overcoming its humanity!"The brainwash lasted a whole hour, while the light burnedand hurt more and more. Occasionally, the prisoner lostorientation, because the sharp light was like a white nebula.Frank tried to fight the pain in his head, but he was at thiscell's mercy. Furthermore, he was in the hands of the cruelblaze and the metallically sounding talk of this steelcomputer woman, that tormented him.„l can't stand this insanity for two weeks!", said Frank tohimself and winced. „l want it to stop! Please, God!", hewhined.

But God didn't hear him. The acoustic insulation of the holocell was much too perfect, deep down in the prison complex„Big Eye". If Frank had a God here, then it was him or her orit, the thing behind the loudspeaker. At night, at 22.00o'clock, the sharp light was switched off. The whole roomsuddenly became dark then. So pitch-dark that even thesmallest source of light did not remain. Frank couldn't see

36

the hand before his eyes anymore and in his head, theaftereffects of the blinding blaze jumped around as manifoldcolors. There was only extreme brightness or extremedarkness in this cell. Whoever had developed the concept ofthis instrument of torture, knew exactly, that this cruel formof conditioning could transform even the unruliest man to awilling slave, within only a short time. And so the first daysin „Big Eye" slowly passed, leaving countless deep scars inthe mind of the young man. But there was no escape. Nopossibility to flee, no rescue by God. Only the devil seemedto be interested in „Big Eye" - probably he had evendesigned this hell on earth.

„Stand tall, patient 111-F-47! Here in „Big Eye" is no quarrelamong the inmates, there are no rebellions and noannoyance - everyone remains for himself, during the entireterm of imprisonment. You, 111-F-47, are one of the first illhuman beings, who have the luck, to receive a therapy in aholo cell. We are happy for you, that the computer-assistedselective procedure has chosen you for this room.Behave willingly, be flexible and learn to respect the rules ofthe system! Not every patient here has the luck, to behealed a holo cell. You are one of the prototypes. Supportthe developers of this new form of healing, by helping yourtherapy to success!", it resounded through the room onemorning.

On other days, patient 111-F-47 was explained, howimportant it was to believe everything the media told him.How necessary it was, to free human beings from theirinstincts, to format and reprogram their minds so that theycould overcome all their natural instincts. Furthermore, howinevitable the sedation of human beings was, so that theycould reach a state of happiness. How important

37

consumption and maximization of profit were, for afunctioning society.

In these long weeks of isolation, the strange artificial daysand the black unnatural nights, it was Frank's largestconcern, not to go insane. The isolation, the boredom and,above all, the haunting light had soon transformed him intoa pathetic creature. He often thought about his father andhis sister, the only members of his family, who were stillthere. Frank's mother had died three years ago, he hadloved her very much and with her death he had lost not onlyhis biological mother, but also his best friend, his closestreference person in this world. The time after her death hadbeen hard. Now, nobody was left to talk to.To his father, Rainer Kohlhaas, who lived in the eastern partof Berlin, Frank had had only irregular contact. Rarely, toorarely, he had visited him so far, if he was honest. ButRainer Kohlhaas was an unemotional, taciturn man, andeach discussion with him was laborious.Frank and Rainer had frequently argued in former times.Often the father had openly shown his displeasure aboutFrank's path through life and had always upholded Frank'ssister Martina, as the positive example. His son had hatedthese permanent comparisons, but now, all this was nolonger important.

From time to time he had telephoned with his older sister,the more successful one of the two children. Martina hadbecome a teacher, had married and Frank had often enviedher, because of her good payment. But one day, she hadconfessed to him, how fraught and exhaustive her job was.She just hated to work on her school.She teached the subjects „Biology "and ..English" at aschool complex in Wuppertal, in the sub-district Westfalen-Rheinland. Martina described the situation in German

38

schools as more than intolerable, and Frank had thesuspicion that she already drank and took tranquilizers. Butshe held on, for her husband and her son, the little Nico.However, citizen 1-564398B-278843 had seen his nephewonly twice and had always been proud to be his uncle.In these terrible days, he often thought about the rest of hisfamily which probably didn't know at all, that he was lockedup here. Perhaps, they would only be surprised about thefact, that Frank didn't answer the telephone since weeks.Perhaps the police had even informed his family members -that he had become an offender and was a criminal now,and had to face his fair punishment in that prison. He justdidn't know, but he could imagine his father's face, if he gotthat message.

J have always said, that the boy wastes his life. Now my oldsorrow has finally been confirmed!", he had probablymurmured. The prisoner didn't try to think too much aboutthese unpleasant things.

„What has happened to my apartment?", he pondered. „l'msure that they have already rented it to another person. Thiscan be done fast if the rent can't be deducted from theScanchip anymore."

In these days, Frank could only speak with himself and triedto handle the pain. But it did not change anything. He hadserved only one month in this room, but Frank already gotthe feeling that he had walked from one end of hell to theother.

It was not easy to persevere here. And the daily tworeeducation hours finally became even the most interestingthings, which happened on a day in the holo cell. After awhile, Frank occasionally even looked forward to them.Nevertheless, sometimes he tried to destroy theloudspeaker, which hung much too high, to tear it down.Then he became so angry that he kicked against the walls

39

or bit in his underarm till it bled. Frank's lonely fight againstwindmills continued for a while in such a way. Alwaysunsuccessful and ever more closer to the loss of his goodjudgement. Sometimes he cried below the loudspeaker,begged for grace and forgiveness and promised to followeach rule and each regulation for all eternity. He swore, tobelieve everything, what they told him. But nobody everanswered.

When two months had passed, Frank broke out in tearsever more frequently or crawled under his light gray plankbed. He thought, that insanity had already found him andskid down into a state of permanent panic. Patient 111-F-47didn't trust his own judgement any longer and felt seperatedfrom the rest of the world like by a great ocean.In the second month of his term of imprisonment, he made"insanity" to his companion. He invisaged him as anotherinmate, as a cellmate.

A very tall guy, gaunt, with completely pale skin and deepfurrows in the face. Also dressed in the correct white cellclothes of „Big Eye". However, if the "insanity" sat besidehim on the plank bed, he unfortunately never answered. Hejust sneered at him, showing Kohlhaas his yellowish-brownteeth. But nevertheless, Frank told his spooky friend a lot ofthings.

Sometimes the patient also imagined, that „Mr. Madness",as Frank called him after a while, snored in the completedarkness of the night, lying somewhere in the room. Thenhe crept over the ground and tried to find his strangecellmate, in order to tell to him that he might be silent. Frankthought about much confusing things and nobody could say,if the young men still knew, that it were confusing things. Itwas a nocturnal trip beyond the borders of humanunderstanding, a mental journey through the darkest tunnels

40

of his mind. And every morning, Kohlhaas was awaked bythat bright, hellish light again.

..That's the army of the light particles, which destroys mylids with their ramming supports, piece by piece, pouringinto my head-fortress with loud screams - slaughteringeverything without further warning. And this cruel hordemassacres my helpless grey cells!", said the young man, ifhe could hardly bear it.

Then he had phases, in which he searched his body ondiseases for hours. He found malicious knots and parasiteseverywhere. His body seemed to be full of degeneratedpimples and strange maladies under the skin, which filledhis mind with sorrows.

At the end of the third month, he discovered some redpoints on the white wall behind the toilet, when he huddledon the ground, in order to protect himself against theaggressive light. Frank was sure that it were traces of blood,which had only provisionally been overcoated with whitecolor by the prison's staff.

Mr. Madness had no opinion about this, he just sat in thecorner and beheld Frank sadly. Often Kohlhaasremembered, whether it was actually possible, to smash hisown head against the wall or the ceramic toilet bowl sohardly, that this torture was over. What would happen?Would the attendants save him, just to let him rot here untildoomsday? Another possibility was, to bite open his pulseveins. Unfortunately, there were no bedlinen or other thingsin this cell, which would have made a suicide possible.But each time, when Frank had these thoughts, he finallylost the courage to do it. Moreover, Mr. Madness alwayslooked worriedly at him in these situations, still sitting in hiscorner. The light disappeared, it was 22,00 o'clock.Starting from the fourth month of his captivity in the holocell, Frank Kohlhaas spent the most days with being just

41

motionless for hours, lying on his belly - under the plank

bed.

„May this damn light hit Mr. Madness! May he sit on the

plank bed! I will stay here. Here, that blaze will never find

me!", he said to himself with a lunatic smile.

Meanwhile, Frank thought about his family more rarely. And

what was the use anyhow? He was separated from the rest

of the world. And his father, his sister or the little Nico, could

not safe him from this horror.

And as the computer-controlled woman voice had already

explained in one of the reeducation hours: „The connections

to family and kinship are errors of nature, and all citizens of

the New World Order must get along without them! They

must be corrected by modern rules.

Interhuman relations harm the new order and obstruct the

economic development. Humans must learn to overcome

them. Having a family is not progressive, it restrains every

advancement. Forget your family, because your new

community is the community of the "One-World". You are

part of the whole, patient 111-F-47, and the whole is a part

of you!"

His only entertainment in this confusing time was to

examine the dust grains on the cell ground and Frank

wondered how many interesting forms and colors he could

find.

Sometimes it was really fascinaiting for him and so he

hardly listened, if the gentle voice of reeducation from the

loudspeaker explained to him, why the old order of the world

was just wrong, and the new order was good without

exception.

When the fifth month began, Frank suddenly became

talkative. He talked with Mr. Madness about a lot of things

and often his speeches lasted several hours. He invented

lectures, which were similar to the instructions of the

42

reeducation hours. Meanwhile, Frank planned to reeducateMr. Madness, a very important personality who had alreadyvisited millions of people around the world.Sometimes he preached the most important facts of eachcurrent reeducation hour, he recited them, yelled them andsometimes he tried to kick or beat Mr. Madness, if his pupildidn't show enough interest. Although, he actually viewedthis gentleman in the corner, who sometimes also sat on hisplank bed, as his cell comrade and friend, he hadoccasionally to give some pain to him, so that he learned.But all his attemps to hit the imaginary man wereunsuccessful. After a while, Frank had kicked a little hole inthe white wall of the holo cell - but he had never hit Mr.Madness.

When another month had passed, Frank had given it up toconvince Mr. Madness, to become also a good citizen of thenew world state. Now he tried to memorize every singleword of the reeducation hours and often he couldcompletely repeat the first two or three minutes by heart.He cried, sang and howled the slogans from theloudspeaker like a parrot. The necessity of the registrationof earth's population, the obligation of obeying, theautoregulation of economics, the inevitability of a societywithout sexes, nations and races, the necessary dissolutionof all cultures and religions, the requirement of inhumanityas the basis of a new humanity.

His memory proved, although it was already owergrown bya mushroom of insanity, as amazingly good. Frank sawhimself as a learner and with bloodshot eyes he cried, whilethe loudspeaker talked: „Jawohl! This is the only truth!"

43

Meanwhile half a year had passed and patient 111-F-47 haddeveloped many possibilities of overcoming the hours anddays. He had even set up an own daily plan in his mind:

- Meal

- Learn as much words from the reeducation hour as I can

- Explain them to Mr. Madness (however, only if he listened)

- Investigate the fibers of the white wallpaper more exactly

- Finding new dust particles on the ground

- Lunch

- Arguing with Mr. Madness

Frank's meal rations came through a hatch in the wall threetimes a day. The inventors of the holo cell had kindly madecertain that he had never to leave this terrible room, noteven for the intake of food.

Two months later, the monitoring cameras of „Big Eye",

which always kept every corner in this big prison complex in

sight, including room 47 in block F, saw a broken man, lying

like dead with face down on his plank bed.

Frank Kohlhaas, patient 111-F-47, seemed to have slipped

into an endless lethargy. Meanwhile, he wished nothing

more than the end of his shattered existence.

The cruel treatment had internally destroyed him, and even

the irrational behavior and the emotional outbreaks, which

had kept him alive for so long, were over.

Over eight months of holo cell had corroded his mind so

strongly, that his body seemed to refuse its service any

longer under such inhuman conditions.

The sharp, malicious light, which tormented him 14 hours a

day, hand in hand with the impenetrable darkness of the

artificial nights, had finally crushed Frank's will to live. The

holo cell 47 in block F, this hell chamber without windows,

44

with only a plank bed, a toilet and a little hatch in the white

wall, was ultimately the winner in this war against insanity.

Not even Frank's only friend, the mutely smiling Mr.

Madness, had had the guts to stay here any longer - he had

vanished.

On 21.03.2028, the light was switched off again at 22.00

o'clock in the evening by the computer-controlled system of

„BigEye".

The unconscious Frank Kohlhaas, who layed somewhere in

this cell, down on the ground, with his face in a puddle of

saliva, was swallowed by the darkness again. He did no

longer notice it.

The next day, the army of light particles started anothergreat attack on Frank's head. With loud crashing it surgedagainst his lids like a battering ram and awoke the halfdeadpatient again. But Frank's will was already destroyed andwhy should he be interested in another day of hundredsmore in this holo cell. He hoped, with the still smolderingrest of his understanding, that he would meet death as soonas possible. Kohlhaas was sure, that he would praise theGrim Reaper like a redeemer, when he would finally come.On 22.03.2028 at 9.45 o'clock in the morning, the electronicwoman voice suddenly resounded through the brightlyilluminated cell. Frank lay on the ground like a dying animaland hardly heard this anymore. The small part of his brain,which hadn't been razed to the ground and hadn't beenbrunt by the horde of light particles yet, was briefly surprisedfor a second about the fact that there was anotherannouncement after the wake-up call. Then Frank's mindswitched off again. Nevertheless, this was unusual.„l_isten, patient 111-F-47! Your holo cell has been given toanother patient by the computer-controlled administration of„Big Eye". You will be brought to the mental hospital "World

45

Peace" in Bonn, where your therapy will be continued forthe next four years and four months. Please beunconcerned, your healing process will not be interrupted. Aholo cell of the same type is available for you in "WorldPeace"!"

The young man hardly thought about the content of theannouncement. They should freight him, whereto they everwanted. He would hopefully soon be dead and free.

But up to the next morning, he still lived. Or better said: His

heart refused stopping, although his owner really wished it -

"from the heart". He hadn't moved at all, during the whole

day and the following night, because he took his desire to

die very seriously.

But the three execution officials, who opened his holo cell

punctually at 8.00 o'clock and entered the room, didn't

understand this. They were the first human beings since

over eight months, who visited Frank here - to bring him

from A to B, from one hell chamber to the next.

„The guy still breathes, but he is totally down!", said one of

the three guards.

„Hey! Stand up, man! Don't waste our time!", remarked

another and kicked Frank in the back.

„Hrrrr!", hummed the prisoner.

„Shit, the guy is really broken! Uwe, look at this!" The third

enforcement officer was astonished. "Bring us some

stimulants! We need some extra help in this case!"

One of the officials departed and came back with a cup of

water and two red pills after a quarter of an hour.

„Hey! Hey, 111-F-47! Open your mouth!. Yes, good boy!

And now, down with it!", he muttered.

Frank swallowed the pills and was able to walk after a few

minutes. He didn't understand, what happened to him and

46

hardly noticed, that he was on the way to leave the

abhorrent holo cell behind him.

„Go! Get a grip, man! Just walk!. Yes, this is good. One foot

before the other one! Forward!", said the guard and

supported Frank cynically.

Patient 111-F-47 had to be carried out of the prison building,

more or less, because he was too weak to walk. After a

while, the policemen simply pushed the young man forward.

„That the guy isn't fit yet, after two pills of steroin!",

remarked the officer with surprise. „Hurry up! The driver of

the transporter is waiting in hall B!"

The three man brought the picture of misery, which oncehad been called Frank Kohlhaas, with the help of steroin, ahighly concentrated stimulant, and some beats against thehead to the transport van.

Frank crept over the three stages of a metal stair and sankdown on one of the seats. His hands were secured withhandcuffs behind his back and he stared at the ground.„Watch out for this guy! He is finished! Maybe he gonnavomit in our van! Ha, ha!", said a guard to his colleagues.„We will watch out for him! Don't worry!", answered one ofthe policemen with a grin.

Next to Frank were two other officers and a further prisonerin the back area of the transport van. The cops were armedwith shotguns and tied Frank, who almost slipped on theground, and also the other inmate, with an additional seatbelt. Both men could only move their legs now.The transport van started moving at 9.00 o'clock, and finallyleft the prison complex. Even if Frank had had theopportunity, to have a last look at the hated place of horror,which had brought him to his knees, he probably wouldn'thave done it. First of all, the back area of the transporter,secured by lattices, had no windows anyway, and secondly,

47

patient 111-F-47 didn't care, where he would find death. If it

was in "Big Eye" or in "World Peace" or somewhere else,

wasn't important anymore. His only concern was, if it would

go fast.

After they had driven one quarter of an hour and nobody

had spoken a word, the prisoner, sitting diagonally opposite

to Frank, hissed: „Hey! Pssst! I am Alf! Who are you?"

Frank ignored the question of the man. It didn't interest him,

who still sat there. He stared at the metallic ground of the

van's back area with blank look.

Suddenly one of the policemen said: „Baumer, you crank!

Stop that damn whispering! Contact among prisoners is

against the regulations!"

J thought, we are patients?", answered the prisoner

sardonically, giving Frank a nod.

Now the policeman reacted. He struck Baumer in the face

and grumbled: „Oh, I'm sorry, asshole! I didn't want to be

impolite."

The prisoner swallowed some blood and saliva and looked

at Frank with psychotic eyes. However, the young man was

still mute and didn't mention the small sign of defiantness,

the other prisoner had shown.

"Alf Baumer!", he thought briefly, then his mind sank again

into a blurred fog.

Alfred Baumer, patient 578-H-21, was a tall man. He had a

dark brown beard, broad shoulders and a tattoo at the neck.

The few hasty looks, Frank had given to him, showed the

picture of an aggressive man, who was about thirty years

old. Above all, Alf's bright blue eyes and the large scar in

the right half of his face were noticeable.

How long the trip had already lasted, Kohlhaas could hardly

say anymore. Perhaps a further quarter of an hour. Alfred

seemed to have the things more clearly in sight. He

hatefully stared at the police officers with his blue eyes,

48

baring his teeth and looking at Frank from time to time. Thisman seemed to wait for something...

49

The Change

In a small forest, close to the highway BAS-74, four men

lurked in the rainy undergrowth and peered eastwards. They

wore camouflage clothes and their faces were hidden under

black balaclavas. Three of them fumbled nervously with

their assault rifles, while another man had a field glass and

gave instructions to his comrades.

„How much longer, Sven?", asked one of the men.

„l will already tell you. They must soon be here! And

remeber: Jens only shoots at the tires, the rest only shoots

at the drivers!", answered Sven. „And don't perforate the

back area of the van by mistake, got it?", he added.

„The whole thing is damn risky. I hope, we will come home

alive!", said one of the men quietly.

„lt is too late for such thoughts now. We will just do it! Check

your weapons!", hissed the young man with the field glass.

The minutes passed and the four men crawled further

forward, in the direction of the road. Sven suddenly stopped,

waving the other men nearer.

„Look! Over there! It's the van! Go!", he called.

All jumped under cover and grabbed their assault rifles. The

transport van, the four men had waited for several hours,

came closer with medium speed.

Another long and tense minute passed, full of doubts and

uncertainty in the hearts of the four men. Then it began. And

while the three policemen, who sat in the driver's cab of the

transport van, were still grouching about the fact that they

had to drive from Bernau to Bonn, just because of the

transfer of only two prisoners, they suddenly saw four

shadows, coming closer to their vehicle from the forest.

50

„Now! Fire!", roared the scout with the field glass and all four

men raised their weapons in the air, rushed forward and

sent a deafening hail of bullets to the transporter.

„Tac! Tac! Tac! Tad", it echoed through the small forest and

the four men continued to shoot at the windshield and the

tires of the vehicle.

With a loud clank, the windows of the transport van bursted

and it turned out in hurling. Then the damaged vehicle

stopped.

„Kill these rats!", screamed a masked men and fired at the

driver's cab. One of the two officials in the forepart of the

van got a headshot and an enormous bloodstain spreaded

over the headrest of his seat. Another policeman was also

hit in the arm and tried to find cover behind the engine

mount, searching for his weapon in panic. The third tore up

the passenger door and fired wildly at the masked attackers.

A salvo of two assault rifles finally sent him to the ground.

Meanwhile, the four men had come so close to the vehicle,

that they could also fire from the side at the policeman, who

huddled between the seats. One of the men raised his rifle

and executed the official with an angry burst.

..Destroy the detector!", screamed one of the masked men

and the guy, who was called Sven by the others, jumped

forward and shot with his pistol at a radio-like thing in the

front part of the transporter.

„Bolt cutters! Hurry! Hurry!", he yelled and the four men ran

to the backdoor of the vehicle.

The sound of gunfire, coming from outside, had not beenunnoticed by the two police officers, who guarded FrankKohlhaas and Alf Baumer. Even patient 111-F-47 seemedto have briefly lost his mental confusion and looked aroundwith surprise.

51

„What the hell goes on there?", said one of the officers,

loading his shotgun. Then he opened the door of the van's

back area. The other policeman followed him.

„Help me out!", roared Baumer at the top of his lungs and

gave one of the officers a kick in the abdomen.

In the same moment, the door was broken up and light fell

into the darkness of the back area from the outside. One of

the guards fired out of the van and hit a masked attacker,

who tried to enter the vehicle. The head of the man

exploded like an overripe melon and Frank stared at a cloud

of blood and bone fragments, while he staggered to the

ground.

The remaining three attackers answered with fire bursts of

their assault rifles and killed the policeman, who stumbled

on the street like a bleeding sieve.

Meanwhile, Frank began to cry like a tormented child. He

shrieked in pain and wildly pulled, in an accumulation of

unrestrained rage, on his additional seat belt, tearing it out

of its holder. Then Frank hit the second guard's face with a

high kick and the man tumbled down.

Now the inmate squealed like a pig and started then to

laugh loudly. Finally, the laughter became an insane

screaming. Suddenly Frank's eyes were clear and gory, and

before the three other masked men had come into the back

area of the vehicle, he had sent the last policeman to the

ground with a headbutt. His hands were still bound on his

back, but he stomped on the guard's face and the man

broke down again.

Frank swooped down on him and bit in his cheek like a wild

animal. A shot from a handgun followed, which had almost

hit the crazy Kohlhaas - then also the last policeman was

dead. Frank howled and still kicked several times in the

head of the dying man. The other men finally pulled him out

of the van. His white dress was blood-smeared and Frank

52

reminded the masked men, who confusedly stood in front of

him, rather of a mad butcher than a prisoner. Now he

seemed to fall in a state of blankness again and sat down,

totally exhausted, on the metallic stairs of the transport

vehicle.

„Well, what's up now, man? Come on! Or do you want to

wait for the next policemen?", asked Alf.

Baumer trailed him and followed the three other men into

the forest. Now it was important to hurry, because the

operation had lasted far too long and, moreover, such a

slaughter hadn't been planned.

Furthermore, they had lost a man and it was just luck that

no other car had come along the country road, otherwise

the bloodshed would have been much worse. The three

disguised men and Alfred, who was trying to propel Frank,

fastly ran through the thicket.

„Move!", roared one of the three masked men. „Dash it!

What are you waiting for?"

Alf Baumer gripped Kohlhaas at the collar and ordered him

to run faster, but the confused young man still walked slowly

behind him.

„lf your buddy does not hurry a little more, I will shoot him,

Alf! I mean it!", yelled one of the three men, who was

running ahead.

Alfred stood before Frank, vibrated him and growled: „This

is your only chance, you idiot! If they get you now, you are a

dead man! Come with me, trust me!"

Frank Kohlhaas hadn't been able to trust anyone in the last

months and the mental bleeding, the holo cell had

demanded of him, had been enormous. But the word „trust"

sounded like a gentle balsam in his ears, that had only

absorbed poison for such a long time. The fresh cold forest

air, he was inhaling now, slowly showed him that this

opportunity to attain freedom, should not be thrown away.

53

Suddenly he ran, ran and ran, catched up with the othersand disappeared with them in the thicket of the forest. Thefive men reached a large field after some minutes, wherewere an old looking and small airplane was waiting for them.They jumped into the flier and shut a rusty door behindthemselves. All were totally exhausted and wheezed loudly,while the plane took off.

„Who is that guy, Alf?", asked one of the three liberators

with an unfriendly undertone and pulled the balaclava from

his face. The young man was blond, with short hair and a

boyish face.

J have no notion! He has been transported together with

me!", answered Alf.

„Tell us your name, man!", demanded the blond man and

regarded Frank with a searching look.

„Frank Kohlhaas, citizen 1-564398B-278843....", hummed

Frank and closed his eyes.

„Your citizen number isn't interesting for us, buddy! We

don't need to have this shit!", hissed the young man, who

was called Sven by the others. „We are free men and no

slaves with citizen numbers."

„Well, I think this man has been in a holo cell. That's the

reason, why he is so abstracted!" Alf tried to explain.

„Such a cell... ", stammered Frank.

„A holo cell? That thing, which is currently tested by the

GSA in all prisons worldwide? Really?", asked one of the

three rebels with surprise.

„No wonder, that you seem to be on drugs. These things are

the worst instruments of brainwashing of our time. How long

have you been in this hellish cell?"

J think, since August 2027...leave me alone...", hummed

Frank quietly and hid his face behind his knees again, as he

had done it so often in the last months. Then he turned to

54

the side and dozed in his usual half-sleep, although theoutdated airplane made a big noise and vibrated during thewhole flight.

In the year 2028, it was not easy to organize an operationlike this, because of the almost perfect air surveillance in"Central Europe". However, this flier was inconspicuous,because it had been registered as an outdated, butnevertheless permitted transportation in the Baltic. If theplane was scanned by the computer of a satellite or an airsurveillance station, it was just shown as the transportaircraft of a man called Matas Litov, a Lithuanian farmer, inthe data bases of the European monitoring servers.The chip card of the plane had been changed by a highlygifted computer hacker, who had made it perfectlyinconspicuous. But even the arts of this man had their limits,and one day the constantly improved monitoring couldprobably also recognize his tricks.

Anyhow, the authorities hadn't been prepared for such abrutal attack on a prisoner transporter. And it was also justluck, that the operation had finally been successful.Frank Kohlhaas, whose citizen number was no longer ofimportance, flew with the others over Poland towards thethe former Baltic states, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.Meanwhile, the three abolished national states had beensummarized with other former countries of Eastern Europeto a single administrative sector.

In Eastern Europe, the complete monitoring of thepopulation and the entire public life was so far not as perfectas in North America or in Western Europe. Many states ofEastern Europe had refused to blindly obey the instructionsof the World Government for a long time. This new powerhad been established in the western regions at first and so it

55

just took longer, until a complex monitoring network ofwestern standards could be installed there.But the World Government also planned the same extensivesystem of total control for Eastern Europe. And it dideverything, to build it up, as soon as possible.In the year 2028, the British islands were the most sharplysupervised area of the world. Here, the doom had built upits first strong bastion in the past, from where it had comeover the rest of mankind.

In England, the World Government already tested andintroduced the next steps for global domination. Forexample, the complete prohibition of sexual contactsbetween men and women, the total destruction of any familystructures, and even a breeding of the population after thedefaults of economic necessity.

Who wanted to fight against this tyranny, was really adreamer and had to have a good relationship to his maker,because the propability to meet him soon, was very high.Like Alf and his fellows, who apparently thought, that theycould change something. Anyhow, Frank Kohlhaas was withthem now - and enjoyed it. He was just happy to breathefresh air and had the feeling, that he had been born again.How often he had begged the Grim Reaper to come, to endthe torture of the holo cell. But the Gevatter apparently didnot want him yet. Now, everything had changed...

56

Outsourced

..Outsourcing" was one of the infamous terms of

globalization, which had broken loose with all its power at

the beginning of the 21th century. Now Frank had also been

outsourced somehow. He had left the administrative sector

..Central Europe" and was "stored" elsewhere.

The old airplane flew over the area of the former state of

Poland, over the city of Kaliningrad, the old Konigsberg,

which had meanwhile fallen into ruins, and finally was on its

way to the Southern Baltic, in order to land in a rural area

north of Vilkija, in a little village called Ivas.

The five men were exhausted and hardly noticed the

landscape below them beyond the windows. Frank was still

disturbed and could only occasionally understand, what was

happening to him. He suffered under strange muscle

cramps and was, despite his constant fatigue, not in the

condition to sleep for longer than half an hour.

His eyes were always half open and he felt, as if someone

had put a bag full of cement on his head. After the airplane

had landed, Alf helped him to step out and led him to an

rundown house.

„Can I sleep somewhere, or just lie down?", asked him

Frank.

„Yes, don't worry! I have found a place to sleep for you!",

answered Alf and pulled the young man into the building.

„We have to discuss something, Frank. You can rest here -

see you later!", said Alf and showed Kohlhaas an old bed in

an untidy and halfdark room with a dark red, peeling

wallpaper. Frank turned to the side and tried to sleep. He

hardly made it, but nevertheless, the young man had the

feeling that he already felt better. After he had been in a

57

condition of dozing for some hours, he finally nodded off. Hedid not dream about anything. It was just black in his head.As black as it had always been in the holo cell, in the eightartificial hours of the night.

Next day...

„We have escaped the next cops by the skin of our teeth, as

I think. I feel sorry for Rolf Weinert, a good man, only 29

years old", said Alf to the others. „Thank you, that you have

delivered me from this hell. I know, I always seem to be

hard and tough, but I was also close to the end in "Big Eye".

That other guy is simply wasted, but it would probably be

the same with us all, if they would cage us in a holo cell for

eight months. This Frank is a poor creature!"

„We haven't planned the liberation of a second man, Alf!",

remarked a young man with red hair.

„So what? What should have been done? Would it have

been right, to let this Frank just die? He would not have

survived one more week in "World Peace", got it?", returned

Baumer.

„Well, actually the fate of an unknown man is not interesting

for us. The only important thing is our own thing, okay?",

said another man sternly.

J will care for him. What will he do? Call the fucking

Lithuanian police?", grumbled Alf with an angry face.

„This is a real problem, Baumer! If the guy becomes a

safety risk, we must kill him. You know about our rules!",

said a blond man.

„l know that, little boy! You don't need to tell me our

principles! I have already joined our fight in a time, when

you were nothing but a panty wetting baby!", hissed Alf in

the direction of the young fighter.

58

„Peace, people! You were successful and you are still alive!Meanwhile, only the big armored busses are used forprisoner transports since two years. This has been anexception! The fact that they have used an outdatedtransport van this time, was just because only two prisonershad to be transferred to Bonn. And a bus would haveexceeded the budget for such an unimportant trip. Thesenew tank-like monsters are not so easy to stop. You need arocket launcher or something like that, to bring them to ahalt!", said a tall man in the background. He was perhapsabout fifty years old.

The man had come later to the small group. His name wasThorsten Wilden, a former businessman, who had fled toLithuania some years ago. Slender, gray haired, with anoblong face and a remarkable pointed chin. The manseemed to be very rational and impersonal, and gave theimpression that he had already gone through a lot ofhardship in his life.

..However, the boy is right. Tomorrow I want to becomeacquainted with this Frank. I hope, he won't make usproblems here, otherwise we have no other choice thansilencing him", said the tall man, who apparently had aleading position is this group of men.„He won't make problems! Nevertheless, the boy is totallyexhausted!", meant Alf and rolled his eyes.„Where is he now?", asked Wilden.

„ln my house. Thus, I mean, in John's house. He issleeping!", muttered Alf. "I will keep him in sight and I willalso bain for him. Is this enough now?""Okay, men!", shouted the leader of the group. "In the nextdays, the good old routine in our village will return for youall. We have to resow and to do a lot of other work. Alf canhelp this new man to recover and I want you, to leave himalone with this task. By the way, HOK told me, that the

59

release operation has been on TV in "Central Europe",yesterday evening. We should watch this report, HOK hasrecorded everything!"

"Yes, have fun with it, I go home now and want to be alonefor the rest of the day", groaned Alf and left the room.

Dusk was falling and Frank lay between some unwashedpillows. A great burden slowly fell from his soul and hismind, which had swollen like a red, throbbing growth. Nowthe pain began to fade away. In the next room he heard arustle, shortly thereafter loud smacking and the sound ofcutlery on a plate. Some minutes later, his sponsor enteredthe room. „You must eat something! Here!" Alf presentedhim some slices of bread and two fried sausages.„Thanks!", said Frank and ate slowly and leisurely. „Youdon't have to worry. Nobody can find us here. We are inLithuania. Far away from Germany and this „One-World"cage called "Central Europe". Eat, and then I let you sleepagain", whispered Alf, trying to calm him down.It was a weird situation. If Frank would have seen AlfredBaumer in former times on the street, then he wouldprobably have gone to the other side. This tall man reallylooked boldly and violent, what he surely was, if it had to be.He gave the impression of the typical criminal, who hadreceived a life sentence.

Brawny, with a dark, pointed beard, a tattoo at the neck anda keen look. Frank Kohlhaas looked, however, ratherharmless and even still juvenile at first sight, although hisbody was also sturdy. He had a dear face with a buttonnose and his good-natured smile was characteristic. MostlyFrank was kind and peaceful.

But in the production complex 42-B, he had lost control overhis feelings and this time had been one time to often. His lifehad almost been destroyed by the consequences of this

60

incident. Compared with Alf, whose face always showedlatent rage and frustration, Frank's countenance couldchange, in a case of extreme excitement, from good-natured to psychopathic. If Frank was really furious, hisgreen eyes started to gaze into space and he threateninglyperked his dark, broad eyebrows up. Then he looked like afanatical preacher, somehow mentally absent, with anindestructible will and ready for everything.Only a few people had ever faced this sight so far, butFrank's angry outbreaks had increased in the last years -slowly and constantly.

Now, however, the former citizen 1-564398B-278843 wasjust glad to be with Alfred Baumer. Although it was a man,he didn't know at all, but who seemed to be a trustableperson.

Despite Alfs aggressive appearance, a honest coreseemed to be under his hard shell. A feeling of hopesprouted in the heart of the young man. He clung to Alfsbroad shoulder and murmured quietly: „Thanks, man!Thanks that you have liberated me! You have saved mylife!"

Some minutes he mutely cried in Alfs arms. Then Baumerpushed him back gently. „lf s okay. You are welcome here!",said Alf, who was simply overwhelmed with so muchsentimentality.

"The others have freed me from this damn prison too. "BigEye" would have been my doom as well. They put me twoyears in incommunicado detention, luckily, I had not thepleasure to get a so called "therapy" in a holo cell.I would have gone to hell there, no doubt. Apart from this,they don't let you just go, when your time in jail is over. Oneor two are also liquidated, if their behavior analysis is toonegative. These damn holo cells have once been anexperiment for perfect conditioning and brainwashing. The

61

former "Mind Control", which the NSA, when it still had thisname, had developed together with many other methods",declared Alf. "These holo cells will be used against allprisoners with politically incorrect tendencies one day. Youhave been one of the first human guinea pigs. It has justbeen interesting from them to analyze, how long you wouldsuffer this torture. Of course, they knew that you would notsurvive this procedure!"

"Fuck these rats!", said Frank and tried to banish thethoughts about the terrible time in the holo cell."The entire political and historical background can't beexplained in two sentences, above all, if you have neverthought about it before", ended Alf his small speech.Frank signaled by turning around and pulling the cover overhis head, that he wanted to sleep now. It was 21.16 o'clockand the young man was still exhausted and weak. He dozedfor a while and examined the shabby, dark red wallpaper,then he fell in a deep and restful sleep.

On the next morning, Frank Kohlhaas felt unusuallyrecovered. He had slept over 13 hours and for the first timesince months, he had not awoken with a start in the middleof the night. He yawned and noticed that Alf had put somefresh dresses beside his bed.

Kohlhaas still wore his white prison clothes, which smelledof sweat and were still covered with dark red traces of thepoliceman's blood.

Frank plodded out of his room and noticed that it was veryquiet in the house. Nobody sat in the kitchen, so that hecould look around without ruffle or excitement. Everythinglooked very poor. Dirty dishes were piled up in a rusty sinkand in the corner of the room, an ugly mold spot was on thewall. Indeed, Alf lived in a hovel - if it was his house at all.However, his housemate seemed not to be here. The young

62

man walked over some old wood stairs to the upper floor,where he found only a few empty and poorly furnishedrooms. One of them was full of cardboards and woodenboxes, almost up to the ceiling. But Alf Baumer wasnowhere to be found.

„Where am I here at all?", thought Frank and scratched hishead.

Since the escape from "Big Eye", he hadn't been in thecondition to think about these strange men, who hadrescued him. Who were they?

He opened the entrance door of the house and steppedoutside, left it open a bit, so that he could come back again,because he had no key for the ramshackle door. When helooked down the street, in which Alf s house was, Kohlhaassaw a lot of further hovels on each side. Some of thehouses seemed to be empty, others had weathered frontsand in the gardens, a sprouting, uncontrolled growth wasspreading everywhere.

Some of the windows had been nailed up with rottedboards, probably long ago. One house had even acollapsed roof. In addition, here and there, one of thehouses had been renovated again and Frank heard thevoices of children out of a side street. He could evenunderstand their language, it was German.Nevertheless, the sun shone on all the roofs, whetherdesolate or repaired again. But many people didn't seem tolive in this rundown village. Finally, Frank saw two men, whounloaded crates out of a delivery van. A tractor rattledsomewhere in the distance and a mature woman leaned outof the window in the house opposite to him.

Frank walked down the road and came to a square, whichprobably must had been the center of the small village informer times. Weed sprouted out of the cracks between the

63

cobblestones, which covered the whole place. Here, in thecenter of this ghost town, Frank could see three old houseswith big shopwindows. Two of the large windows werebroken and the buildings looked dilapidated. Theshopwindow of the other house was completely plasteredwith yellow cellotape. In the center of the square was amemorial stone, completely overgrown with all sorts ofgrass and bushes. It was surrounded by a wooden fence.Kohlhaas could hardly recognize the memorial stone and,apart from this, the inscription on it was in Cyrillic, so thatthe man from "Central Europe" could not read anything.On the stone, a soldier with a helmet and a rifle was shown.Nevertheless, Frank had already seen this helmet from theold time in a history book. Furthermore, he was able todecipher the years, which had been engraved on thememorial stone: 1941 and 1989.

The young man continued his walk and regarded amoldered church, which stood next to the village square. Itsroof was damaged and had enormous holes, bricks coveredwith moss and lichens lay in front of the rotten, wooden frontdoor, that was adorned with a hardly recognizable picture.On the tower was a rusted cross of iron. The winged thingon the door of the church, which was completely overgrownwith lichens, was probably an angel, that had symbolicallywelcomed the people at the entrance of the church in theold times.

But in a world, that had been left alone by God, perhapseven this angel had lost his "job" one day. Frank pushed thelarge wood door to the side and climbed over a pile ofplanks, in order to reach the inner part of the old church.Dried out leaves, dirt and dust were everywhere on theground in front of him. The benches of the old building weredirty and everything made the impression of being lost. Thealtar was also damaged and had small tears and cracks,

64

probably because of the cold of a hard winter. The visitor

finally turned his head towards the ceiling and examined the

wooden frescos on the walls, which also showed traces of

decomposition. Frank beheld some angels, that were

fighting against strange looking demons or something like

that - creatures from hell. Other frescos depicted mother

Maria and Jesus Christ.

"The superstar of Christianity...", said Frank to himself and

smiled cynically. This church appeared old and somehow

also sublime. The chapel had possibly been built in the late

Middle Age, but Frank did not know it for sure. He knew

nothing about history.

But the young man didn't care about the age of this church.

Only one thing was true - the building touched his inner

self, although, he never had believed in anything.

Maybe just because it was beautiful and old. In his previous

world, he had never beholden an old building. Gray

plattenbauten, dirty streets, underpasses and factories were

nothing new to him, but he had never looked at old

churches or castles. This house of God was just like a

memorial of a forgotten time. A time far beyond this dark

age.

The church had probably been the heart of this village for

many decades or even centuries. At this place, the people

had prayed to a higher power, begging it to take care of

them. But in the end, it all had come differently. In the year

2028, mankind was alone, and Frank had never noticed a

higher power, that wanted to protect its children.

„Father, if you exist at all, why have you left us?", said Frank

quietly to himself and looked at the fragile ceiling of the old

building again. Then he went back to the square.

He walked through the hopeless village for several hours.Again and again, up to the other end and back. Around the

65

locality were fields and forests, and only a muddy streetseemed to connect it with the rest of the world. The youngman sat down on a bank and looked at the sky, when threelittle children, probably those, who he had already heardbefore in the side street, ran across the road in front of him.They briefly examined him and smiled, but Frank didn't takeheed of them.

Somewhere a dog barked in a house, which lookedinhabited. He stood up and passed some vacant, rundownhouses. This village, the renegate citizen had alreadyforgotten its name, was a bleak place, as Kohlhaas thought.Nevertheless, he prefered this village to the rotten, formerFRG capital Berlin, his old home. He wouldn't miss thecriminality, the cultural and racial tensions and all the decay,that was typical for the shabby metropolis, where he hadgrown up. Now he was here. In this strange hicktown...„lvas!" Now Frank remembered the name of the village. Alfhad said it several times. Ivas, somewhere in Lithuania. Butwhat was this for a strange village? Frank Kohlhaas waspuzzled.

Meanwhile, he was tired and his shoes were completelycovered with mud. He finally decided to return to Alfshouse, because the front door was still open, although itwas improbable, that the other villagers would steal fromthem. It was not like in Berlin. Soon the day came to an end.Frank didn't know yet, where he was here.

„ln three days we must leave this house, Frank! I must leave

it too, because it is doesn't belong to me", explained

Baumer after a meager lunch.

„As I already guessed. Whose house is it?"

„lt belongs to another villager, who is currently in Minsk to

buy some things", answered Baumer. „Wilden has said, that

we can live here for a few days. If the owner comes back

66

home, we can surely move to one of the other vacant

houses in the village."

„What is that for a odd village?", murmured Frank.

„Wilden will explain it to you tomorrow. Actually, he already

wanted to talk to you today, but you were not here. You took

a little walk, isn't it?", said Alf, whose tiredness meanwhile

shone in his eyes.

„Tell me, where are you from, Baumer?", asked Frank

suddenly.

„Well, I was born in Dortmund and have lived in some other

cities in the Ruhrgebiet, also in Frankfurt am Main, for four

years", said Alf and took another tea.

„Why have they brought you to „Big Eye"?, Frank became

curious.

„My God, you ask a lot. But well, you will have to remain

here in Ivas, this is hopefully obvious to you, and therefore, I

will tell you a few things about me."

Alfred Baumer decided to make another camomile tea and

went to the boiler. Then he fetched a cigarette and began

with a small lecture about his life.

Frank actually didn't want to know all the details, but Alf

seemed to look forward to a little speech. Now he was

awake again.

J had troubles with the authorities since my 16th year of life.

I was active in various political groups, which you don't

know, as I think. Anyhow, they are all forbidden since many

years.

I have already been in jail for one year in 2013 - when the

political system of the FRG still existed. They have punished

me for so called "opinion crimes" - because I have designed

a few Internet sites, which were uncomfortable for the state.

At that time, I was just 19 years old. My parents have lost

their jobs during the great world economic crisis in 2012/13,

and have jettisoned me after my term of imprisonment. I

67

have never returned back home again. Afterwards, I have

lived with some friends, in various housing groups, and of

course also alone. After six years, in 2020, I have joined the

Red Moon groups, always trying to live inconspicuously.

Nevertheless, it has gone wrong."

„The Red Moon groups?" Frank looked surprised. „They

were terrorists, isn't it? These guys have burned a hospital

in Berlin, right?"

..That's nonsense! Lies!", grumbled Alf and gave Frank an

annoyed glance.

„l'm sorry. They have said it on television at that time",

remarked Frank and tried to calm down his comrade.

„On television...on television...! Nevertheless, fucking

television is even the biggest lie of that world system, man!

Didn't you understand this yet?", grunted Baumer and felt

accused wrongly.

„No offense meant!", apologized Kohlhaas.

„No, it is a lie, Frank. The Red Moon groups publicy

protested against the World Government and united

thousands of young people in their fight. Opponents of

globalization, free philosophers, patriots and others. After

that damn hospital hoax, which the media exaggerated with

all their might, we were criminalized. It had been the work of

the GSA, the international secret service, there is no doubt

for me. It has not been activists of our group! However, the

following crusade of the international media, broke the neck

of the Red Moon organization. Tell me, why should a group

of freedom fighters burn innocent people in a hospital?",

asked Alf with visible rage.

„Do you see the tattoo on my neck? This is the „Red Moon",

the blood-red moon of the fight for liberty - our old symbol!"

„l don't know enough about all this and I don't care...", said

Frank. „l only know, that I hate that goddam World

68

Government, that terrible system - from the bottom of my

heart!"

„Then Ivas is the right place for you, my friend!", said Alf and

stared at his tea cup, clenching his fist.

„And then?", asked Frank.

„Then? Then I was still active. After the Red Moon groups

were forbidden worldwide, we continued our struggle in the

underground. Finally, I was arrested during an illegal,

spontaneous demonstration, which I have organized with

some of my comrades. I had to go to jail again.

My time in „Big Eye" began and I can be glad, that they did

not find other loading material during the house search at

that time, otherwise I would have been liquidated."

„What material?", questioned Kohlhaas. Alfred Baumer

looked at him and shook his head.

„You ask very much for a man, who still was flat on his face

a few hours ago. Never mind! That would have made me

more than just some problems, believe me. So I was

sentenced to nine years of detention, only because of the

spontaneous demonstration. I would have never endured

that. In my time as an activist of the Red Moon groups, I

became also aquainted with some of these weird guys from

here. They have already told me years ago, that I should

escape from the sector "Central Europe", to come with them

to Lithuania.

Nevertheless, I was not willing to give up the fight in my

homeland, because it was my aim, to liberate it from this

global insanity. Today I say to myself, that it was just stupid

to wait for so long. It would have been wiser to leave

"Central Europe" in time, because the great enemy is much

too strong in the West."

„Well, now you are here. And me too. The best thing that

could happen to us, Baumer. This fucked up sector "Central

69

Europe" shall go to hell, it shall rot forever!", hissed Frankand wiped off some tea drops from his lip."We must not let our compatriots go to the hell! It is ourcountry! No, we are not on vacation here! We just relocateour fight. We will only surrender, when the maggots corrodeus in our graves!", answered Alfred and put his foot down.Frank was astonished and observed his partner, whosnatched the teapot with a loud curse. "We are not onvacation here!"

Frank was surprised about this statement, his housematehad shouted out with so much passion. What did Alf meanby that?

Again, Frank Kohlhaas slept well and firmly. He had

amazingly regenerated himself, in this short time.

Sometimes he even felt euphoric.

„l am not even afraid of the devil!", he thought then and

smiled proudly.

But it was not that simple. The aftereffects of the holo cell

were far more malicious, than he could imagine and they

were still there, deep in the dark corners of his brain. They

just lay in wait and planned to erupt, in order to strangle

Frank's peace of mind, while he was sleeping.

Like the mourning, after the death of a beloved person,

usually comes in waves, it was the same with the mental

horror, the holo cell had unleashed in Frank's mind.

The dread had only entrenched itself and waited now, in its

fortified position, for the signal to attack Frank again. No, the

fright wasn't gone. But in these first days of his new

freedom, Kohlhaas had a peaceful time - so far.

The rain pattered on the corrugated iron roof of the smallshed in front of Frank's window, and the untiring noisemade him wake up. It was already after ten o'clock on this

70

wet morning and the young man rolled from one end of the

bed to the other. Suddenly Alf entered the room and said:

„Good morning, Frank! Please get up! Wilden is here and he

would like to talk to you!"

The village boss already sat in the kitchen and sipped his

coffee. He welcomed Frank friendly and told him to follow

him to his house after the breakfest. Somehow, the situation

was unpleasant for Frank, but he tried to avoid problems

and obeyed.

„We must talk about some things, Kohlhaas!", remarked the

leader of the village community, who wore a long gray coat

and a hat with a narrow brim.

The rain had softened the muddy roads of the village, and

Frank waded behind the somehow authoritarian and

impressive Mr. Wilden through the dirt. After a short foot

march, they finally came to an amazingly well renovated

house, which was even surrounded by a beautiful garden.

„We go upstairs!", said Wilden.

The former entrepreneur sat down behind an adorned desk

of dark wood and remained silent for some minutes. Frank

took a seat on a soft armchair of black imitation leather,

which smelled cleaned. He looked around. The room

seemed to be an office and was in a perfect condition.

Everywhere he could see pictures on the wall with the light

brown wallpaper: battle paintings, framed photos of some

great men from the old times and a lot of other things.

„Well, Frank Kohlhaas. Do you like our village?", asked the

gray-haired man, smiled and tried to take the uncertainty

from his young guest.

„Nice!", was Frank's short answer.

„Nice!", repeated Wilden soberly. J want to make it short,

and I will not talk around the bush", said the village boss

and looked out the window.

71

Then he continued: „This village is called Ivas. It is in the

area of the former state of Lithuania, in the southwest part

of this actually beautiful country. It is small and insignificant.

A small village, that has been abandoned by its former

inhabitants under the pressure of the worldwide economic

collapse some years ago. A ghost town, as you may know

them from North America.

"Aha...", said Frank.

„This village is so small and so unimportant, that even the

sharpest eye must look twice to see it", explained Wilden.

..Therefore, I am safe here!", joked Frank.

..Well, security is relative. Particularly in our time, Mr.

Kohlhaas. Above all, nowadays!", said the host quietly.

„But here...", remarked Frank.

„As I already said, Frank Kohlhaas", interrupted him Wilden.

..Today it is a benediction to be safe. You are here in Ivas,

an insignificant village, in an also not excessively important

country in Eastern Europe. This village is so unimportant

that even the big eye, the eye, which can see the whole

world and always wants to see more, did not notice it yet.

Do you know, what this village really is, Frank?"

„No! Just tell it to me!", Frank reacted nervously.

..Then I want to explain it to you exactly. Where you are

here, and with whom you are here!", answered the man with

a serious look. ..This is no usual village in the contemplative

Lithuania and we are no holiday community. We are rebels,

who fight against the World Government. Ivas is one of our

bases. Some of our men live here, with their families or

alone.

A few of these ramshackle houses, I had acquired for

relatively small sums from the former Lithuanian state in the

period of its dissolution. Finally, my fellows and me settled

in this abandoned village. Some more men will still come

72

and we will establish our position here. But there is one

important rule: Everybody has to be quiet!"

Frank wondered. ..Rebels against the World Government?",

he thought and beheld Wilden with surprise.

„l think, I know, what you mean!", he said then.

„You came to Ivas and you will stay here. We can't let you

go, because you already know too much and this is a safety

risk. Even if you tell just one single word about us and this

village, we must kill you! I say it to you not as your foe. This

is the situation, in which you are, Frank Kohlhaas!", spoke

Wilden and nodded. „And believe me, we will not hesitate,

to wack you immediately, if you endanger our group!", he

said with a cold voice.

„l understand!", Frank was more than confused.

"But I don't want to threaten or frighten you, my friend. You

had suffered enough and I wish you a good recovering here.

Furthermore, I don't want to force you to join us. Just trust

Alf, he is a man with a pure heart and could even become a

good friend to you. Moreover, he bailes for you and told me,

that you are a nice person", said Wilden and smiled again.

„l want to rest, as a start, and then I will take a look at your

organization. And believe me, I'm really grateful, because

you saved my life. Don't worry, I would never betray you. I

give you my oath", said Kohlhaas to the older gentleman

and sounded resolute.

..Trust me, Frank. You are here now, and you will find your

peace of mind among us. And on the other hand, there is no

turning back for you anymore. If they would ever catch you,

you would be liquidated immediately.

You are registered as a terrorist and a murderer, in all

worldwide databases of any administration and authority,

and a so called "normal life" is an illusion now. Whereby,

however, it becomes clear at a closer look that we are the

only ones who live a "normal life", because we are free men

73

and no slaves of this global system, born of terror and

oppression", explained Wilden with a more gently becoming

voice.

„l wanted to thank you again...", whispered Frank quietly.

"No problem, my young friend! I am glad about the fact, that

Alf and the others didn't let you die", answered Wilden with

a paternal countenance.

The talk with the founder of this base took a long time and

Wilden became more and more kindlier. It seemed, that the

older gentleman, who had appeared so cold at first sight,

would have a fancy for Frank.

Since 2013, when the great crisis had shaken the entire

globe and had driven millions of people into poverty,

destroying innumerable existences and finally even leading

to famines, this village had been left by its former

inhabitants.

The collapse of the economy in Lithuania had caused a

mass exodus of young people, who had been driven by the

illusion, to be able to find jobs in the countries of Western

Europe.

Villages like Ivas, which had lived on retail trade and

agriculture to a large extent, had just collapsed, and their

inhabitants had moved into the larger cities of the country or

to the West.

A ghost town had finally remained and meanwhile the rural

areas of Eastern Europe were full of abandoned villages.

Thorsten Wilden, the former entrepreneur from Westphalia,

had decided in 2018, when the shadows of a global

dictatorship had come over the former FRG, to leave his

homeland and to acquire houses in Ivas with his last money.

Wilden had already been registered as a political dissident

in the databases of the secret service, even at the time of

the FRG. He had too often been noticeable. When the

74

entrepreneur had stood for a political incorrect party against

the FRG system in 2012, the media had tried to

economically ruin him with a big campaign. The German

had already thought about emigration in these days. But he

had still persevered for a while, although the media had

called up to boycott his company and his family had been

threatened by incited fanatics. And the situation had

continued to become worse. During the great world

economic crisis, the entrepreneur had lost the biggest part

of his fortune and had become a target for the political

police of the FRG.

Thereupon, Western and Central Europe had been shaken

by a breakdown of the social system and racial and religious

conflicts. Europe had finally been close to civil war.

In the year 2018, Germany had been taken over by the

World Government, while Wilden had escaped to Lithuania

with his family.

He had offered the rest of his savings and had bought some

of the empty houses and also a few properties in Ivas, for

relatively small sums from the collapsing Lithuanian state.

The dying national state, which had been driven into

complete bankruptcy by the crisis, had been glad about

each cent that a foreign investor had given.

In the years 2018 to 2020, the World Government had been

established. The new rulers had promised the masses to

master the great crisis, and had moreover seized the

opportunity, to abolish the old states of Europe.

Then a massive wave of liquidations of political incorrect

persons had followed. Who had been located as a

suspicious person, had been arrested or killed by the

ruthless oppressors.

Shortly afterwards, the Lodge Brothers had founded the

international secret service, the GSA, to eliminate political

opponents. Campaigns of mass arrests, mass liquidations,

75

brainwashing, terror and intimidation had been the order ofthe day in this years. Finally, the face of Europe had beencrushed to a bloody pulp. Only in the USA, the GSA had stillraged more effectively and had executed even larger partsof the population as in Europe.

In this time of terror, Wilden had already escaped to EasternEurope and had overcome the first onslaught with his familyunharmedly. However, many of his political fellows of thattime had disappeared in prisons or mass graves.Nevertheless, the terror had reached the countries ofEastern Europe too, but the preparatory work for a perfectsurveillance state had only been made half-heartedly andlanguidly here. Moreover, the registration of the wholepopulation wasn't as extensive as in the West yet. So thestrike of the World Government against the nations of theworld, had lost a lot of its power in Lithuania.Apart from this, Russia and the other states of EasternEurope had become members of the world system in theyear 2020, two years after the official takeover of the newrulrs. Here, some air for breathing had still remained. Butthe Lodge Brothers were willing to make up leeway, in thecountries outside of North America and Western Europe.

After these difficult facts and explanations, Frank had neverthought about before, he was impressed by Wilden's talentto elucidate things. Altogether, he was fascinated by him.Communities of men like Ivas, had some more time to live inpeace, but the officials even pressurized the sector "EasternEurope" more and more, to create a modern system of totalcontrol. So also in Ivas, strictest secrecy was increasinglynecessary to survive, and Wilden's village had ever moreproblems to keep up the image of an unimportant village,inhabited by some farmers. HOK or Holger K., who didn'tbetray his surname to anyone, except for Thorsten Wilden,

76

was one of the most important men in Ivas. The formercomputer scientist was a master in tampering scanchipsand to rewrite registration datas of vehicles and airplanes ina way, that they were inconspicuous. After four hours, FrankKohlhaas finally left the house of Thorsten Wilden. This newworld really impressed him and for a man like Frank, areturn to his old life was impossible at this point.

When the young man came into HOK's study two days

later, he was welcomed by a thick, burly man. The

information scientist sat in front of a big, wireless computer,

surrounded by a lot of crates and cardboards, which were

repleted with all kinds of things. He looked like the typical

computer genius and reminded Frank of a comic figure.

HOK smiled and examined Kohlhaas from top to bottom.

Meanwhile, he scratched his head and gabbled something.

„You need a new Scanchip? You will get a new Scanchip!

He, he!", said the weird computer scientist and typed on his

keyboard.

„Oh! I am HOK! Specialist for electronic questions and other

problems in this beautiful village!"

„Hello!", said Kohlhaas.

„Oh, how good that nobody knows, how uncle HOK is really

called. A little joke, I always like to tell", returned HOK and

hastily waved his lower arms. „And soon, also nobody will

know your name anymore!"

J will always be Frank Kohlhaas!", answered the young man

and grinned.

„Sure! And I will be always HOK, even if I am sometimes

Mike Weber or Enrico Althaus", said Holger K. with a

philosophical undertone.

„However, you will get a new Scanchip now, because

otherwise you are just fucked up in this world."

77

HOK let the keys rattle and worked for the next minutes as

under hypnosis in front of his computer screen. He visited

various servers and data bases and explained, that it could

last a while. Anyway, he had to generate a large number of

new access codes and this was a lot of work. His virtual

attacks on the secret servers of administrative districts and

registration banks had remained unnoticed so far, and could

not be retraced. The coding and safety precautions, which

HOK used, were impressing and reflected the quite entitled

paranoia in his head.

„This computer officially stands, from its source code, in

Patah Keadan in Malaysia. Sometimes I also attack from

Siberia, northern China or Angola. This is always very

funny!", gaggled the cyberfreak and smiled proudly.

J believe you, man. But I know nothing about computers!",

groaned Frank .

„Code here and code there..."

"No, does not fit..."

"Shit! Why not?"

"Ah...Okay!"

"Well, there we have been landed..."

"He, he, he..."

"Well!"

And: Go!"

"Starting from the data..."

"Great!"

"Copy!"

"Paste!"

"Mist! Elender Mist!"

HOK murmured and continued to swim through a sea of

datas and facts in the international cyberspace. He vacantly

stared at the screen and Frank was just silent. Then

Kohlhaas finally sat down on a damaged office chair, which

probably had already suffered under HOK's weight.

78

The operation lasted almost three hours. In the meantime,Frank had gone out of the house, to take a little walkthrough the village. When he returned, the passionate cyberfanatic expected him. HOK grinned from ear to ear. Then hetheatrically made a curtsey in front of his new client:..Welcome citizen 08-711369Y-191947, in our wonderful„One-World"! I may call you, nevertheless, here among usand completely unofficially, Maximilian Eberharter, okay?"..Sounds amusing, but good...", returned Frank...Your Scanchip account has also been topped up again.Congratulations!" HOK seemed to be very happy. He haddone his work like a pro.

Referring to the general defaults for citizen registrations,Frank Kohlhaas was now announced as the proud owner ofthe citizen number 08-711369Y-191947, living in Graz andworking as an underground construction engineer. His wagewas not bad too. Over 1300 Globes per month, he hadnever earned that much.

Who this Maximilian Eberharter really was, Frank did notknow and he did not ask. Perhaps the citizen number 08-711369Y-191947 had been discarded, because the ownerhad died. Perhaps, it was also just invented, rewritten orsomething else. HOK surely knew, what he did.Indeed, the computer scientist with the weird behavior andthe emotional fluctuations, was just irreplaceable in Ivas. Heprocured official registrations for the inhabitants and toppedup their Scanchip accounts, gave them "jobs" and securedtheir income - at least, as a computer file. This man wasingenious. No question!

Additionally, the village community also subsisted on anown agriculture and various illegal exchanges andcommercial transactions. It functioned better, than the newborn citizen could ever imagine.

79

Nevertheless, Ivas was a dangerous place. And only, if allinhabitants kept their mouths shut and never boasted, aninconspicuous life was possible. Regarded from the outside,this village just appeared inconspicuously and its citizenswere even good taxpayers, who were not noticeable to thetax authority of the sub-sector "Belarus-Baltic".From this point of view, they all were in a favorablesituation. It would probably just become unpleasant, if anofficial would ever examine this place more exactly. Butsince the financial situation in the sub-sector wascatastrophic and the region was in a permanent state ofworst poverty, it was improbable, that authorities, whichhadn't enough employees, because of staff savings, wouldever send someone to an unimportant village like Ivas. Thelethargic officials were just content, if the taxes were paidregularly.

This mentality of indifference, which was far common inEastern Europe, increasingly annoyed the powerfulgentlemen of the World Goverment. Nevertheless, in formerLithuania still existed an administration, but this was notself-evident in other regions of the world.In Africa, the World Government had never tried tointroduce a complete monitoring of the population at all,what was much too difficult. But from the position of theLodge Brothers, this was not necessary on this continent.The African countries were politically insignificant and it wasonly sufficient, to recruit parts of the population as cheappeons for the big concerns. Furthermore, the WorldGoverment held the whole continent in an iron grip ofdependence by indebtedness. Occupation troops enforcedthe rough adherence of the instructions from above. Thiswas enough. Otherwise, the World Government onlyoccasionally intervened, in order to decimate the population.Hunger blockades and even epidemics, made in

80

laboratories, ensured, that the population could not grow toomuch. Other countries, for example in Eastern Asia, werealso controlled from the outside. The new rulers simply usedthe weapons of financial dependence, the military threat oreconomic sanctions.

In these regions, including India and China, the Scanchiphad been introduced as replacement for credit and identitycard a few years ago, but the number of people in thesecountries was just too big for a close monitoring.Together with the downfall of formerly high technicalisedEurope, the infrastructure in these regions slowly moldered.Nevertheless, the World Government also wanted to acceptthis challenge. Much still had to be done. At first, the 1.9billion Chinese and 1.5 billion Indians had to be decimated,that further political steps could follow.The appropriate plans for this cruel process, were already inthe drawers of the think-tanks of the New World Order. Theyworked on it.

In the last decades, the nations of Europe, once highlydeveloped and sophisticated, above all Germany, England,France and Russia, had successfully been destroyed by acreeping procedure of decomposition by the predecessorsof the now ruling forces. Finally, they had brought theEuropeans to their knees. Knowing about theirinventiveness and their ability to create high civilizations,they had purposefully selected the Old World as theirprimary target. And soon they had taken control of the GreatPowers of the old age.

And it had been the same with the North Americancontinent. These regions had to be taken at first, even if itwasn't always easy to conquer them. But the hidden powerbehind the curtains of world policy, had acted intelligently,cleverly, shrewdly. There was no doubt, if one analyzed the

81

past. In the old age, the Europeans had been proud andstrong, and had patronized values like freedom orindependence. Therefore, they had to be slowly poisoned,as you never attack a powerful lion directly, but put it tosleep or sicken it first.

It would last a long time, to describe all the procedures,which had made the world to the sad place that it wastoday. But it was nevertheless a cruel fact, that these oncegreat old countries were in just one hand today - withoutexception. The European nations crumbled, decomposedand were close to total extinction.

Foreign people were brought to these lands, and soon allthe big centers of European civilization were a puzzle ofdifferent races, cultures and religions. The internationalyoke of modern slavery and the imperative to consume,preached by all the media of the global system, was theonly thing, which connected them. And this had alwaysbeen the plan.

So the danger was avoided, that united fronts could beformed one day against the world dictatorship, because theinterests and purposes in life of the numerous nationparticles and cultural fragments were too different. It hadworked well, the hidden forces had infiltrated the Old Worldlike a virus.

The plan had been successful and the Lodge Brothers hadlaid the foundation, for what the Elders of the New WorldOrder had already prophesied long ago: The "Multicolor-Man". A so called "united" human, without clearly definedorigins, torn inside his soul and groundless."Will will create the Eurasian-Negroid future-race!", was theslogan of this new policy. So the powerful gentlemenworked on a creature without an own culture, without ahigher intelligence and without an identity - the natural bornslave.

82

World Peace in Ivas?

„Not this Ronald Miller shit again!", groaned Alf on the nextmorning, as he sat in front of his laptop and watched thenews from all over the world. On an Internet site, which wasofficially marked with a blocking note and should actuallynot be accessible for "good normal citizens", he saw thecommemoration ceremony of a soldier of the internationalGCF troops in New York, kidnapped and shot by Iranianpartisans.

The video had already been shown by the official televisionstations, but the forbidden Internet site complemented it withsome background informations and let its content appeardifferently, from what the media of the system wished.The World President squeezed out some crocodile tears infront of the cameras, which rolled along his beaked nose.Then he thanked the not anymore "unknown soldier" for hisfight against terrorism, for human rights and world peace.The television report showed Ronald Millers crying widow,his newborn baby and his daughter in the kindergarten. Thereport about his sweet little children lasted a whole hour.The daughter told, that she liked to paint pictures with herwax mark pins, loved her hamster and finally cried for herdead father - in close up.

The World President visited her in the kindergarten, tried tolook affected and explained to the kindergartner, howimportant it was, to go on with the war against Islamicfanatics and renegade tendencies in all regions of the world.„Those fucking media rats should mention, that the WorldGoverment has nuked Teheran nine years ago!", screamedAlf furiously and banged on the table. "So they could alsomake some good video reports about crying children there!"

83

He turned around to Frank. „At that time, over one million

people, women and children, were burned to ashes. The

GCF just wiped them out, in order to make an example!"

„l know... ", answered Kohlhaas.

„Oh, shit! I just hate the fucking media! I would execute

them all, if I had the chance!", he spat out.

„lfs the usual propaganda", said Frank and went into the

kitchen. „Calm down, Alf! Don't risk a heart attack..."

Baumer still grumbled for a while and finally followed Frank.

He stood before his fellow and raised the forefinger.

„Today John comes back from Minsk", he said. „We must

talk to Wilden, so that he tells us, where we can live here in

the near future."

..Living together with you? Then I will give you the

prohibition to watch TV!", answered Frank with a smile.

..Don't make me angry, little boy!", hissed Baumer, grinned

villainously and made some boxing movements toward his

interlocutor.

The discussion with the leader of the group was short and

factual. Wilden told them that they could move into another

vacant house at the further end of Ivas. It was an incredible

hovel, but at least, it had an old wood fired oven and the two

men could even get some electricity for the barrack.

When Frank and Alf returned to their provisional home, they

met a probably 45 years old man in a cord sweater,

unloading some crates from a shabby, white combi-van.

With him was a beautiful young woman with long fair hair,

which she had tied up to a queue. John and the woman

welcomed them.

„Oh, who are you? Allow me, I'm John Thorphy!", he

introduced himself.

..Julia Wilden!", added the blonde and smiled.

84

„Alfred Baumer, we don't know each other yet", answered

Alf.

„Eh... Frank Kohlhaas!", said the young man.

John Thorphy had a strong English accent, which, however,

clarified the question of his origin only superficially.

„We lived in your house. Thank you again. We have been

freed, straight from prison", explained Alfred.

„No problem!", replied John and continued to unload his car.

„rm sure that my father has organized everything correctly",

said Julia and examined Frank with an inquiring look.

„And how was it...?" Frank tried to begin a conversation.

„How was what?", asked the young woman and stroked with

her fingers through the blonde hair. Then she beheld

Kohlhaas again.

"Where you have been...I mean...your trip...?"

"Nice!", returned Julia.

„The man is... eh... John...an Englishman?", asked Frank.

„No, and he does not like Englishmen!", he heard from Julia.

John is an Irishman. Don't talk with him about England or

even Englishmen..."

"It was just a question", said Frank and looked unconfidently

at the young beauty.

"Okay, all questions have been answered. Now you can

help us to unload the van", said Fraulein Wilden and kept a

straight face.

„No problem!", answered Baumer and waved Frank nearer.

In the following weeks, Frank and Alf had a lot of work to do.Necessary renovations in their new home waited for them,and furthermore, Wilden gave them some more tasks, in thename of the community. Kohlhaas became acquainted withsome of the other villagers and thought that most of themcould stand him - more or less. However, a few still facedhim with distrust and avoided to talk to the young man.

85

Nevertheless, the fact that he had been in a holo cell,

caused a mixture of compassion and respect in many of the

villagers.

Julia Wilden mostly just ignored him and didn't seem to

seek his proximity. He rarely saw her, even when he

unusually often walked past Mr. Wilden's house, although it

was located in a side road.

„She looks good, but she is „Misses Important", the

daughter of the great boss...", thought Frank sometimes.

"She thinks that she is better than the rest here and she

obviously doesn't trust me very much."

Frank was right. Julia Wilden and also the young Sven

belonged to those villagers, who avoided the contact with

him.

But Kohlhaas tried to understand the behavior of these

people. They didn't knew him and he had only come to this

strange place, because of luck and coincidence. What

should he expect now?

Prison or even liquidation would wait for them all, if he

would prove himself as a blabber or a safety risk. So the

fear of the unknown man wasn't unjustified. But Alfred

Baumer and Thorsten Wilden seemed to like him. The

village boss took every opportunity, to explain to him any

political and historical facts. He started with world history,

from the ancient cultures of the Indogermanics, over

Alexander the Great, up to the present. Sometimes,

however, even everything at the same time.

„They could have used Wilden for the reeducation hours in

the holo cell, apart from the fact, that he preaches the

converse theses. Nevertheless, he talks even more than

that computer!", said Frank to Alf once.

Baumer admired the former entrepreneur, because of his

universal knowledge about politics and history, but this time,

he had to laugh about Frank's statement. So the days,

86

weeks and months passed in monotonousness. Often someof the villagers disappeared for a while. Occasionally, evenone of the three small transport aircrafts left its hideout, inorder to fly somewhere and to come back again a few dayslater.

The airplanes were always hidden under camouflage netsor in large, old barns. Although it was not illegal to ownthem, since they had been duly registered, caution was thefirst rule in Ivas.

In the meantime, Frank and Alf were working hard, in orderto make their house more habitable. Wallpapers wereprocured over many detours, because there were no moreshops in the periphery of many kilometers, which got sucharticles. At least, the most important rooms could berenovated.

Similar difficulties also appeared with the building materials,which had often to be taken from the other vacant houses,for example intact bricks to repair the leaky roof. It was along and toilsome work, but the two men became friendsalong the way.

There was still only a very old wood fired oven in the biggestroom of the house and both men became a bit nervous,when the thought about the coming winter of the year 2028.At the end of the month, Frank's sleep disturbancessuddenly came back. He had scary nightmares, in which thecruel light of the holo cell tortured him again, and also Mr.Madness returned.

Sometimes in these dreams, this strange man talked, andFrank was surprised that his voice was high and shrill.Baumer often woke him up, when he flailed or talked whilehe was sleeping. It was weird. Right now, where peace hadentered his life, compared to the time in „Big Eye" even theidyl, the bad memories came back. Kohlhaas had thought,that the pain in his mind was over - but he was wrong...

87

One day in August, HOK stood in front of the entrance door

on an early morning and asked Alf for Frank. Kohlhaas sat

in the provisionally furnished kitchen and came to the door

after a few minutes.

„Good morning, Frank! Please come with me, immediately!",

said HOK with a sad face.

..What's up?", asked Frank with an uncomfortable feeling

deep inside.

..Hurry up! Just come with me!", answered the computer

specialist and spreaded a disastrous atmosphere.

Shortly afterwards, the two men went to HOK's house and

Frank hardly noticed the warm and bright autumn sun,

which stroked the little village on this day. HOK ran to his

untidy office and sat down in front of his computer.

..Please take a seat, Frank!", hummed HOK. „And try to stay

calm, with all, I will say to you now!"

„Tell me, what has happened?", claimed Frank with a

mixture of impatience and deep concern, because HOK's

countenance let expect nothing good.

„l have examined your old Scanchip. I meant no harm by it,

but it is an order of Wilden, concerning each new person

that comes into our village. It is a safety precaution. The

Scanchip is examined for suspicious sub-datas and cross

references. I penetrated an internal data server and studied

some not public informations, which are automatically

collected about every citizen in the sector ..Central Europe"

by authorities or secret services. These sub-datas contain

many informations about a citizen's life. Of course, the

ordinary people don't know anything about their existence.

Okay, I have the skill to look for all this stuff. Let's see..."

„Aha...", answered Frank with a complete lack of

understanding.

„An usual Scanchip has about 500 internal sub-datas and

cross references, which can't be read by the owner,

88

because they are only for the authorities", explained HOK

hastily.

Frank's brain was tormented again with some technical

terms of the computer language, although HOK tried to

explain everything understandably for the layman.

The sub-datas of each Scanchip contain a fulness ofinformations, for example:

- Behaviour analysis at the workplace

- State of health, for the further economic utilization

- Income

- Consument behaviour statistics

- Social compatibility

- Subversive statements at the telephone, on the internet...

- Family members and relatives

- Reactions on political propaganda and advertising

- Religious faith

- Friends and acquaintances

- Frequentcy of contacts to friends and acquaintances

- Sexual behavior

There are still hundreds of further informations and details,

but I think you know, what we are talking about", said HOK.

„And now? What's wrong?", asked Frank quizzically.

Just wait!", answered HOK. „l have to look for some special

things. For example, if there is an entry like: JOS" (informer

of the state) or „ROP" (receiver of official privileges) - what

would mean, that you are an informer - or you have been it

once."

„What do you want from me? Tim no informer, man!",

screamed Frank.

„You don't have anything to do with such things! Your old

Scanchip is clean, don't worry!", calmed him HOK.

89

„This is not the problem...", he continued. „We must be very

careful and everybody in Ivas has to endure this process!"

„Then you want to establish your own little surveillance state

here, isn't it?", gnarled Frank angrily.

„No, we do not want that!", replied HOK and seemed to feel

ashamed.

„l looked at the cross references, concerning your family

members and your relatives. I'm sorry, this didn't belong to

my tasks and I must excuse myself for that", murmured

HOK sheepishly and stared at his keyboard.

„And then you pretend to fight against the World

Government! Maybe these guys were also just bored, and

so they decided one day, to spy out all the other people!",

grumbled Kohlhaas.

"I'm sorry! Really!" HOK tried to calm down his angry guest.

..Unfortunately, I have noticed something terrible on your

Scanchip: Rainer Kohlhaas is your father, right? And

Martina Gunther, born Kohlhaas, your sister, isn't it?

Nico Gunther your nephew...? "

..What's up with them?", asked Frank excitedly.

„The Scanchips of Rainer Kohlhaas and Martina Gunther

are shut down. Their citizen numbers will be assigned to

other people in the near future...", spoke HOK quietly.

"What?", Frank winced.

„On the Scanchip of your father, there is an arrest note on

09.04.2028. At the beginning of June 2028, it has finally

been shut down. As additive there is a footnote: "ODOA"

(official deactivation by official arrangement) and further

„CSO" (citizen switched off). He has been liquidated!",

explained HOK.

..What?", cried Frank in pain.

„lt's the same in the case of your sister. She was first

arrested, and then liquidated. Your nephew..." HOK was

interrupted.

90

„What? What's up with Nico?", gasped Frank with fright in

his eyes. "Tell me what..."

„He is registered here as an "orphan in national care". So he

is still alive!" The computer scientist didn't dare to look in

Frank's direction.

But it didn't work. The young man was speechless with

terror and sank back on the chair. He struggled for air and

tried to shake off the claws of horror that griped his throat

and took his breath away. But it was impossible.

Within a few seconds, he fell into a black hole of despair

and ran crying out of the house of the computer scientist. All

the distress and the fear had returned now. They had

spared him in the last months, to come back in this second

in their whole, dark size.

In the next days, Frank hardly left his sleeping room. Alftried to explain to him, that the arresting of relatives orfamily members was used by the system, to luredisappeared offenders out of their hideouts, to make themring up at home, while the telehone call was bugged, or tomake them even visit their old homes. But Frank just toldhim to back off.

Now the scary nights returned and the mental terror, theholo cell had kindled in his mind, crawled around him in thedarkness, arm in arm in old unity with the new horrors.Again, the young man thought about following his parentsand his sister to the netherworld, he mused aboutterminating his hopeless existence, but Alf stopped him fromdoing such things and cared for Frank as good as he could.

When September brought the autumn to Ivas, Frank wasafflicted by a strange dream one night. He could no longercompletely remember each detail, when he woke up again

91

on the next morning with a bad headache, but the mostpictures remained in his memory.

He was a spectator in an hall, which looked very similar to acourt room. In front of him were the judge desk and thedock, and only this place was lit by a lamp. The rest of theroom remained in a hazy twilight, also the seat rows of thespectators, on which Frank sat alone. In front of the dockwere two persons and Frank could not exactly recognize,who it was, because he saw only their backs. Behind thejudge desk was no human being, it was rather a shadow ora ghost.

"The negotiation starts!", called the shade. „Be quiet please!Today, we talk about the following criminal case: Thepolitics against Mr. Rainer Kohlhaas and Mrs. MartinaGunther, born Kohlhaas."

The two accused turned around and gave Frank a fearfullook. It were his father and his sister. Now they turnedaround to the judge again, because he began with hisremarks. The spectator nervously stared at the ghost andtried to decipher the name on the plate, which was on thedesk in front of him. Only after an arduous staring, Frankwas able to recognize that there was no name. The onlywords on the plate were "The Politics". Now the judge readout the charges and began with the interrogation.J will start with you, Mr. Rainer Kohlhaas", he said with aglowering, deep voice. „Can you remember, that you haveever cared about the important facts around me?"„Well, I have already been concerned with you, if it hadsomething to do with my life", stammered Rainer Kohlhaas.„Can you describe that more exactly?", asked the judge.„Thus, I watched TV and read the newspapers", RainerKohlhaas tried to explain.

92

„And you, Mrs. Martina Gunther? Did you have ever

seriously worried about me?", grumbled the shady judge

with a threatening voice.

..Perhaps not enough. Only sometimes. I was too busy,

most of the time. My job was full of stress and so I had other

things on my mind than thinking about you...", replied

Frank's sister sheepishly.

„And it was the same in your case, Mr. Kohlhaas?",

resented the judge angrily.

,,1'm sorry, but if Tm honest, I have just worked all my life,

and have primarily cared about myself. It was a constant

struggle to survive and to make money. And finally, there

has been no more time to think about any politics",

explained Rainer Kohlhaas ruefully.

„And you really think, that was enough? That you could just

ignore me in all these years?", hissed the ghost.

"Please forgive us, Mr. Judge! Today, we know that we

have made a big mistake! But we still have watched the

news on television...", Rainer Kohlhaas tried to justify

himself.

"Yes, I did the same!", agreed Martina.

"And you think, it was sufficient, if others talked about me

and you just parroted their slogans? Why didn't you think

about me for yourself?", asked the shadow reproachfully

and stared at them.

"Forgive us, Mr. Judge, but we viewed many other things in

our life as more important, than caring about politics!",

lamented the two accused, full of sorrow.

Suddenly Frank appeared at another place in his dream. Adisgusting stench became noticeable to him at first. Itcrawled over the ground right into his nostrils. He was on agreat field that extended till the horizon, and only somemountains were recognizable, somewhere in the far

93

distance. Now he saw, what covered this field. It werecorpses. Hundreds, thousands, millions. They terribly stankand rotted. The grey, dead skin of the bodies was shrunken,and larvae, maggots and worms crept out of the mouths andeye sockets of the dead.

This graveyard was gigantic, it was full of men, women,children - some had died lately, others were already putridand had become skeletons.

Frank had to be careful, trying not to slip and fall by walkingon this carpet of bones and rotting flesh, because the sea ofthe dead seemed to be endless and it filled the plain till thehorizon. The young man simply went straight ahead forsome hours and he was scared of this terrible environment.But the plain still extended and was still covered withcountless corpses. Then he suddenly recognized, that themountains in front of him were gigantic piles of skulls.Millions of skulls, towering up, to create an atrocious picture.Frank walked through the land of the dead and when healready thought, that he would never find a way out of thisterrible world, he suddenly heard a voice.„Frank Kohlhaas!", it resounded from somewhere farbeyond. The dreamer went to the place, from which he hadheard the voice and could soon recognize a dark spot thatcontinued to grow, the nearer he came. Then he saw that itwas the shadowy man, the eerie judge, who called him.J am the politics, Frank Kohlhaas! Nice going, my boy! Nowyou have found me! Here they are!", said the ghost andpointed at the ground.

There lay Rainer Kohlhaas, his father, and Martina Gunther,his sister. Both had been killed with a headshot and theirbodies were rotting, while maggots crawled over their faces.

94

"Mark my words, Frank Kohlhaas! If you don't careabout politics, politics will care about you one day!",

shouted the judge.

Frank startled up and could not sleep anymore for the restof the night...

The rest of the year 2028 passed without any changes in

the life of the young man. The winter in Lithuania was really

unpleasant and very cold, and there was no sign of that

global warming, the international media had proclaimed in

2011, in order to justify coercive measures and further

restrictions of civil rights.

Frank's fear, his sleep disturbances and his depressions

still came in waves and particularly in these dark winter

months he had to suffer.

Wilden and the other villagers had given him a lot of tasks,

he had to do for the community. And this was good,

because it diverted him. During autumn, the fields around

Ivas were harvested by the inhabitants and the yields were

made winterproof, like in old times.

All this was also a new ground for Frank, since he had only

eaten the cheap food of the big agrarian companies so far.

Moreover, Alf and he renovated the old house, but they

progressed slowly. Apart from this, the young renegade was

not yet ready to join the group of rebels - if it were rebels at

all.

Except for talking, Frank hadn't noticed any considerable

rebellion, although Wilden told him everything about politics,

without having a break.

His daughter didn't seem to think a great deal of him and

Frank was sure that she still distrusted him too. But at least,

he had aroused her compassion. ..Nevertheless, ti is

something!", thought Kohlhaas.

95

When it was stormy outside and the ice rain patteredagainst the still leaky windows, when it was dark and cold,Frank felt lost. Even if Alf was in the next room, looking forsome new informations on the Internet. SometimesKohlhaas heard him rant and sometimes Baumer jubilated.„ls this my life for the next decades?", he occasionally askedhimself. „ls this my fate? Hanging around in this dump inLithuania, with this gang of so called freedom fighters?"If he saw the face of his father and his sister in front of hisinner eye, if he thought about the holo cell and about thefact, that his little nephew was raised somewhere in aninstitute for brainwashing, while his sister, who had neverdone something wrong in her life, was rotting in a massgrave, he was fuming with rage.

„Alf, what is the meaning of the symbol of the "Red Moon"groups? Please explain it to me again?", he asked his fellowone evening.

„l already answered that question!", remarked Alf, whowanted to go to bed.

„l want to know it - exactly!", said Frank with a black look,which even caused some respect in Alf.„Well, it is an old cult symbol. The "bloody moon" or „blood-moon". The old Celts, just as many other people of theancient times, knew this mystical indication. In the winter, itwas more important than everything else. At that time, thecattle was slaughtered in great numbers before thebeginning of the snowfall on a certain full moon night.Therefore, our ancestors called this moon the "blood moon".Moreover, it was also a ritual for the old gods, in order toinvoke their protection and assistance in the cold months.The elders cast a magic circle with blood, drank red wine,prayed and danced. Some even believed, that during thisritual not only the souls of the decedents were present, but

96

also the spirits of the animals, which had donated their lifes

to give food to the humans", explained Alf.

„Then it was some kind of ritual for the dead?", asked Frank

then.

„This is one meaning. The other meaning is the coming war,

the revenge, the bloodshed, the rage of battle. One also

knows the bloody moon as a warning to the enemy. It just

depends on the interpretation of the symbol. The founders

of the „Red Moon" groups thought, that this sign would just

look cool or interesting", said Baumer.

„l like the second meaning! Yes!", hissed Frank.

Alfred looked at him with surprise, scraping with his fingers

over the wooden table.

„l_et us bring the blood moon upon our enemies! I will talk to

Wilden. If I join your so called rebellion, I fucking want to

make rebellion!", grumbled Frank.

„We are rebels...", returned Alf and stared at his aggressive

fellow.

"I hope it! I want to take lives!", screamed Kohlhaas and

banged his fist on the table. „Revenge! Blood moon!"

Frank turned around and went to his room. He slammed the

door behind himself and up to the next morning, Baumer

didn't see him again.

97

Rebellion and Fresh Snow

It did not last long, until Ivas was covered with a thickmantle of snow and it was bitterly cold. Frank and Alf couldonly stay in the largest room of their house, where the oldwood fired oven was located.

This season was more than unpleasant and often both menneeded some blankets to warm theirselves. But at least, theroof didn't have no more holes and it didn't snow into theupper floor of the old building. This was better than nothing.Today, Frank Kohlhaas made the decision to talk toThorsten Wilden. He wanted to become a real rebel andpromised himself to join the fight - but he still didn't knowhow.

It was a grey winter morning and the few sources of light inthe inhabited houses of the village, had no real chance torepel the twilight.

A resolute Frank trudged through the fresh snow of the lastnight, toward the house of Thorsten Wilden. The young manfinally had enough of the monotonousness in this so calledrebel base.

„You want me? You can have me!", he whispered tohimself.

After a while, Frank reached the house of the village bossand knocked on the door. Agatha Wilden opened and Juliacould be seen behind her in the corridor. Kohlhaas gavethem a quiet „Hello!". Then Wilden appeared on the stairs,which led to the upper floor.

„Frank! Welcome! What can I do for you?", asked the gray-haired gentleman with sursprise. The village boss seemedto be overslept and was still unshaved.

98

„We need to talk, Mr. Wilden!", answered Frank with a

vacant expression, which neither Julia nor Agatha Wilden

had ever seen before. Kohlhaas scowled and crossed his

arms.

„Well, we go to my office!", said the rebel leader.

„Okay! Let's go!", muttered Frank and went up the stairs.

Then both men sat opposite to each other and Frank started

to talk, before Wilden could begin.

„This is not a holiday camp, you have said to me. Well!

Well!", spoke Frank with an angry face. „This is a rebel

base, you have told me, Mr. Wilden!"

„lt is!", returned the older gentleman, looking at his young

guest, who behaved queerly today.

„AII right! Then we shall start a rebellion! First, I would like to

learn to shoot! Assault rifle, machine gun, handguns. Is that

okay, Mr. Wilden?", said Frank, somehow demanding.

J think you can!", answered the village boss.

„Great, Mr. Wilden! I am ready now. I know that some of the

guys here talk about me after the slogan: We just feed that

Frank, but he is useless and does not join our great fight.

Well, here I am! Ready for combat! If there is a big fight

here at all, because I haven't noticed a fucking rebellion

yet!", teased the young man.

„First and foremost, we develop self-sufficient structures.

The armed operation, concerning your liberation, has been

an exception. Otherwise, we plan no further things of that

character for the next time", explained Wilden.

„However!", said Kohlhaas. „lf any special operations start,

then let me know it. I will join them. My life isn't important

and I will show you, that I have more guts, than most of

these farmers, who treat me with scorn. Thus, you let me

know, if there is some action, okay? Have a nice day and

greetings to Fraulein Julia, Mr. Wilden!"

99

Frank knocked on the table, smiled informally and left theroom. He ran down the stairs, murmured a "Tschuft!" toJulia and closed the front door behind him. Thorsten Wilden,his wife and his daugtherwere perturbed. This part of Frankhad been unknown to them yet. And Frank was surprisedabout that side of his personality too.

"If I shall revolt, I have to learn to shoot, Alf! Where are your

weapons?", Frank edged his unnerved friend.

"You make my nerves explode, Kohlhaas! What do you

want from me?", screamed Alf. His roommate didn't stop his

urging and slowly became aggressive.

J go to Wilden!", grumbled the young man.

„Okay, I have a gun. If you like, we can do some firing

practices in the forest", groaned Alf.

„AII right! What are you waiting for?", answered Frank with a

grin.

Baumer went into the cellar and finally returned with a Glock

in his hand. Then the two men left the house.

„rm dying to know if you hit something!", teased Alf his

friend on the way to the nearby forest behind the village, but

Frank just gazed at the ground. After they had waded

through the high snow for a while, Alf stopped.

„Do you see that knothole in the birch over there?", he

asked Frank.

„Of course, give me the gun!", answered Kohlhaas.

Without further thinking, the young man aimed for the tree,

which was about ten meters away from him.

„Bang! Bang! Bang!"

Alfred ran to the birch, after Frank had shot the magazine

empty. He was astonished. Most of the bullets had hit the

little knothole and large pieces of crust had been torn out.

„Not bad, boy!", he remarked and waved the inexperienced

shooter nearer.

100

„How many times have you already shot in your life?"

„Never before!", answered Kohlhaas and smiled.

„Your lately grown self-confidence seems to make even a

good shooter of you", murmured Alf.

Shortly afterwards, Kohlhaas shot three further magazines

empty. Then they had to stop, in order to waste not too

much ammunition. Baumer was quite impressed, that his

fellow had hit the target relative exactly.

„Wilden can organize an assault rifle and a machine gun for

you. Then you can practice with them", promised Alf. A little

later, they went back to their house again. Dusk was falling.

So strange and insignificant it was, at first sight - Alf s

compliment had filled the young Frank with pride. He smiled

confidently and looked already forward to the next firing

practices with the bigger war weapons, the real "Wummen".

Apparently, he had a talent for shooting. And that he had a

talent for something, he hadn't heard all too often in his life

before.

Frank spent the first two weeks of the cold and wet January,

the ugliest month the year, with numerous firing practices

and the reading of political and historical books, that Wilden

had given to him. Moreover with occasional works for the

community.

Meanwhile, he felt a little more accepted by the other

villagers, after he had signaled that he was ready to join the

fight.

Even Julia Wilden had smiled at him for the first time, when

he had asked her father for more ammunition for his

weapons at the door. He blustered into the thought of

becoming a rebel. Therefore, Kohlhaas shot during his firing

practices, in his mind, rather at hazy prison guards,

policemen or politicians, as at bottles or trees. Often he

grinned like a happy child, when the cold steel of a rifle slid

101

into his hand. His shooting results became better and betterand when he went to bed, after an arduous day, he oftenmused about the blood moon and did not notice, howmalicious his smile had become.

Alfred observed him with scepticism. Frank appearedcalmly, and sometimes he just absently stared out thewindow and bit on his lower lip, till it began to bleed.Usually he did not even seem to notice it. The young manwas eager to learn the art of killing in all its facets. Often hetalked of nothing else but fighting during the dinner. Hephilosophized about the possibilities of resistance, therevolution and the counter-propaganda. Some ideasappeared to Alf even ingeniously, others were just childishand crazy. Something proceeded under Frank's skullcap,was slowly bred like an evil child.

In these days, in which Frank only talked about assaultrifles, grenade launchers and methods of killing people,Baumer thought, that Kohlhaas was screwy. Moreover,Frank asked John Thorphy to buy a whole arsenal ofweapons for him.

„Maybe, your beloved war will find you sooner as you think,my friend", told him Alf once. "We will have a bigger meetingat the end of the month, then I can take you with me!"„A Meeting? What meeting? To shovel some snow?",scoffed Frank.

„Fuck off! I can't hear your speeches about the revolutionanymore, Frank. Keep cool and find the way back to reality.We will not start to run around like a horde of boozy apes toshoot everybody. Do your firing practices or throw your knifeat trees or do something else!", grumbled Baumer angrily.Now, Frank became angry too and went to his undercooledroom. Most of all, he had liked to kick Alf in the face - orsomeone else. Meanwhile, Kohlhaas was burning inside like

102

a torch. A stubborn hate had crept into his brain and he hadproblems to suppress this feeling. So the young man justbrooded and escaped into a dreamworld full of rebellion andrevenge.

The former citizen 1-564398B-278843 dawdled away till the

end of the month and nervously waited for the meeting, Alf

had talked about. From now on, Baumer didn't tell Frank

any further details, concerning the gathering, and just

ignored him.

It was the last day of January 2029, and the restless young

man had got up early today. The meeting of the villagers

was set for 18.00 o'clock, and Frank walked through the

cold house for hours, like a nervous tiger. He friendly smiled

at Baumer, again and again, full of expectation.

In the late afternoon, Frank and Alf finally left the house and

went to a brightly lit-up barn, where a few radiant heaters

had provisionally been stationed. Wilden was waiting for

them here, in the middle of a larger group of people.

Frank and Alf briefly welcomed the others and went to a

dark corner. Both crossed their arms before their chests and

looked at Wilden, who started his speech: ..Welcome, my

dear comrades!"

Kohlhaas nodded to Julia, who stood behind her father.

Then he smiled and the young woman smiled back.

..Tm glad that all of you have come to Ivas. I welcome our

guests from France and all the others, who visit our village

today."

Kohlhaas' expectation rose to the immeasurable. He gave

Julia a volatile look again. She winked at him and Frank

winced, because he had never seen such a friendly gesture

from her before. Her father continued: ..Tm sure you all

know, what is our topic today. Tve bought this village some

years ago, anyhow, some of the houses, in order to create a

103

retreat for all, who have pure hearts and want to fight

against the global system of enslavement. Since then, we

have achieved a lot and this former ghost town has been

made to a halfway habitable place again. We have our

peace here - so far.

However, I have the impression, that many of us meanwhile

enjoy this calm life so much that they have forgotten, what

the true sense of this base is. The sense is to have also a

place for a free life, for those, who still know, what freedom

really is, but Ivas is more than that. It is a place of

resistance against the World Government.

The last months have been calm, we have behaved calmly.

We have renovated our village and have secured our

subsistence, what is essential before you start a great fight.

This phase is finished now, and the question remaines, how

we can bring back freedom to our brothers and sisters in our

old homelands. The fight must begin now!"

A short applause from the about 100 persons in the large

barn followed. Frank was staring into space with blank

expression.

„Most of you, who are here today, live in Ivas. Others are

from the outside. Andrej is here, from the "Russian Patriotic

Section", Robert and William from the organization „Free

Britain", moreover our friends from Belgium, better from

Flanders. Further, Baptiste and Hugo from France. And also

comrades from Scandinavia have visited us.

Apart from this, I don't want to forget Soheil and Nirvan, the

rebels from Iran, because they probably have the longest

way behind themselves.

Unfortunately, our comrades from the Spanish „Citadel

Group" had not been allowed to leave their country, and I

hope they are fine. Well, I think that I haven't forgotton any

other guests from outside!", said the village boss.

104

„Now I want to give a lecture on our actual topic: Today wetalk about March the 1st, 2029, when the World Governmentwill celebrate the "Festival of the new World". Thisworldwide event, which takes place in Kiev this year, here inthe sector ..Eastern Europe", is also celebrated in Paris, in"Central Europe". For that reason, the new governor of..Central Europe", Leon-Jack Wechsler, will come to theformer capital of France, in order to open the ceremoniesand military parades.

The international media will report about this event, wherebythe ceremonies in New York and Paris will be the politicallymost important ones, and will get the greatest attention."..That much is clear!", whispered Alf quietly...Since the official takeover in the year 2018, thecelebrations of the "Festival of the new World" have alwaysbeen an enormous spectacle, that even excelled the soccerworld championships and the Olympics!", said Wilden...Even if the media have hushed it up in the last months,France is a country, which stands close to big chaos. Theintroduction of the "additional water consumption tax" in thelast year has annoyed millions of people.Furthermore, the poverty of the masses is still becomingworse, as everywhere in "Central Europe". Meanwhile, theconflicts between the Moslem Algerians and the otherimmigrants, who have the majority in all big French cities,and the native population, has achieved an explosiveextent. If the GCF occupation troops wouldn't press the lidon the cooking pot with outermost force, France would fall topieces tomorrow", explained the rebel leader, while the twoFrenchmen nodded approvingly.

..Already in the last year, there have been social and racialriots in Paris and Marseille with almost 1000 deads. Thepolice and the GCF have finally shot down the peoplewithout mercy. We all know the pictures", said Wilden.

105

„Anyhow, it has still become worse this year, as I havealready expected it. More monitoring, more unemployedpeople, more homeless people, more crime and more war inthe streets, as everywhere ..Central Europe", where the socalled philanthropists give us their political benedictions!"„He talks about politics again...", groaned Frank...What will we do now? What will we do on 01. March 2029,when probably between one and two million spectatorscome to Paris?", asked Wilden the others.„lf the media and so many people are there, why don't wemake any spectacular actions? With transparencies forexample...", suggested a villager.

„We plan a lot of such things, and we don't need any foreignassistance for these simple campaigns. We have enoughmen in France for actions like that!", explained one of theFrenchmen and shook his head.

..Perhaps, we should join the crowd and...", said a youngman.

..Wait!", interrupted him Frank suddenly. „We kill that Leon-Jack Wechsler! Than we would set an example!"Wilden and the others turned their heads toward the darkcorner, from where the bold proposal had come. Frankstared back and kept a straight face...Forget about that, boy! Around Wechsler is a security zoneof two kilometers, full of GCF soldiers, agents and cops!",said a man and looked disdainfully at Frank.„No more nonsens! Just shut up!", hissed Alf nervously...Well, but throwing leaflets at the soldiers during the parade,or stick out the tongue at the governor, is just pathetic!",returned Frank. „l will kill this son of a bitch! Who comeswith me?"

Now Wilden intervened, because many visitors becameangry: „We should be realistic. There is no place here formacho behaviour, boy!"

106

„l'm not joking! Absolutely not!", screamed Frank. „l know

that it is dangerous, but I don't fear death. Thus, who wants

to follow me? Let us kill this motherfucker!"

„Enough, Kohlhaas!", yelled Wilden.

„Who are you, young man, that you have such a big mouth?

You are hardly a few days here and you already play the big

gorilla!", insulted him a young woman from the other corner

of the room.

..That's right! You are that crazy guy from the holo cell. And

there, your brain has been damaged!", shouted someone in

Frank's direction.

„We don't need your show, boy!", it came from the side.

„Now, shut up! This is just embarrassing!", railed Alf and

nudged Frank.

„l am Frank Kohlhaas! I say it now, in front of all of you,

although I don't know the most of you very well. I will go to

Paris to kill this fucking Wechsler, if you give me the

weapons and the equipment. Maybe I die! So what? I just

give a shit on that!

I swear, by my honour and my name, the good name of my

father and my sister, who were murdered by people like this

bastard Wechsler. If I change my opinion tomorrow, then I

beg you, to shoot me, because then I have no right to life

anymore!", screamed Kohlhaas.

Baumer sighed and held his head. Others looked

disbelievingly at Frank. Nevertheless, some of the villagers

seemed to be fascinated by the young fanatic. Julia Wilden

belonged to the latter group, as Kohlhaas hoped.

„The guy is crazy!", Frank heard someone say.

Wilden tried to interrupt Frank's lecture: ..Well, I would like

to tell you a little more about the political situation. Frank,

just shut up now!"

But the young man had not finished yet: „l have to say

something to you glorious rebels! And you shall listen to my

107

words: I WILL KILL LEON-JACK WECHSLER! Or the copswill kill me! I mean it. If necessary, I will go all alone. Itwould only be nice, if one of you brave warriors could giveme a map of Paris. If I should have changed my opiniontomorrow, then you have to kill me! I ask you again: Whocomes with me?"

A loud mutter went through the barn. Alf lookedembarrassingly at the ground and tried to explain hisneighbor that Frank could also be "normal".It took some minutes for Wilden to restore silence.Meanwhile, the young man had gone back to his corneragain and seemed to have calmed down.„Mannomann!", hummed Baumer. ..Everyone here reputesyou as a total crank now. Killing Leon-Jack Wechsler? Suchan imbecility!"

Alf s friend didn't answer and just looked at him with coldeyes, then he grinned grimly. For the rest of the meeting,which lasted not much longer anymore, Frank behavedcalmly, giving a black look to everyone, who seemed todoubt about his fanatical resoluteness.The two Frenchmen, Baptiste and Hugo, who obviouslybelonged to a patriotic group from Northern France, brieflyexplained, what they had planned for the day of the festival.They were sure that the masses in the capital of formerFrance would be dissatisfied and rebellious enough, to goon the barricades. Some Islamic groups from Paris had alsoagreed to a temporary pact with the organization of the twoFrenchmen, although both sides actually were swornenemies. But on this particular day, they would fight againsta common opponent, the World Government, and so theyhad put their differences aside this time. However, they justpostponed their fight for the supremacy in former France. Itwas not improbable that the new governor of ..CentralEurope" was awaited by the hate and the displeasure of big

108

parts of the population, but whether they would dare it, to

carry their discontent on the streets, was another question.

Leon-Jack Wechsler and the whole World Government were

internally hated by many people, but the powerful had an

enormous might, which the masses feared with good

reason.

The police force and the monitoring functioned. The GCF

troops, which mostly consisted of mercenaries from

overseas, who had no closer relationship to France or

Europe and therefore shot at the native population without

hesitation, if they received the order to do this, were

numerous. Furthermore, they had deadly weapons,

particularly to strike down large crowds.

Soldiers of French origin mostly served in countries far

away and not in their homeland. So they also had no

connection to the people they had to control. Like that were

the rules of the New World Order.

GCF soldiers of German origin preferentially served in this

time as occupying forces in the Near East or in Africa, while

old Germany was occupied by GCF soldiers from Africa,

Asia and other regions. And so it was everywhere.

When the meeting came to an end and the visitors left the

large barn, Frank was examined by many of them. Alfred

Baumer was still confused. His fellow seemed to stand

close to insanity. Julia Wilden finally came to him and

tapped the young Kohlhaas on the shoulder.

„Hey, Frank!", she said quietly. The rebel turned around and

stared at her.

„What the hell was that? You know that your idea is just

madness! What is wrong with you, Frank?", she asked

quizzically.

„rm all right, Fraulein!", answered Frank harshly.

„However, you will not really try this?", she returned.

„Of course I will try it! Do you think, Tm a twaddler?"

109

„None of us would come only hundred meters in the vicinity

of Wechsler", remarked the woman.

„This will be my problem - and not yours! You can organize

a city map of Paris for me, this would be a great help,

Julia!", answered Kohlhaas and regarded Wilden's daughter

with a vacant expression.

„l know, you think that many of the other villagers don't take

you to be a real rebel - and it is also partly correct - but

such a suicide operation is just senseless", said Julia, trying

to change his mind.

„lf you say so. It is my life and my concern. I don't force you

to come with me. Hand out your leaftlets or spray some

philosophical slogans on the walls. I will do, what I think is

right!", said Frank. „The others may think, what they want. I

don't care about these idiots. They want to be rebels? I can

only laugh! Well, the release operation of Alf and me was

not bad, but we have to do more things like that. Those

fucking guys, who destroy our lives, just think that they are

invulnerable! But they can also bleed and die like all other

people too. It's time to hold them accountable for all this

shit! It's time to make them pay for all their crimes, Julia!

And I will show those fucking pigs, that they can also be

switched off. I will go to your father tomorrow and then I will

ask him, to give me the necessary equipment for my

operation!".

„But...", whispered Julia.

„l have to go now!", said Frank and left the young woman

alone.

The following days were full of disputes with Alf and Wilden,who meant that the Frank had made a fool of himself.Nevertheless, he didn't listen to them and becameobsessed by the thought, to kill the governor of ..CentralEurope", in order to point the way for others. And some of

110

his proposals were not stupid at all, although they appearedcrazy and daring.

„You want to enter Paris as a visitor with your falsified

Scanchip. Okay, that could be possible", said Wilden.

„Border controls had already been abolished, since the

times of the European Union, and today, in a time of free

trade, they would be even inconceivable, from the economic

point of view. The close monitoring of the masses is much

more effective."

Yes, I know!", answered Frank impatiently. „How can I get

through this security zone to shoot Wechsler? Should I take

a sniper rifle to kill this guy?", asked Kohlhaas.

„This will be difficult, because in the periphery of at least

one kilometer, security forces will be everywhere, also on

the high buildings and of course inside the zone", replied the

village boss.

„When will the police establish this secured area?", asked

Frank.

„Maybe two or three days before the event. But I don't

believe that you could hide there somewhere, boy!",

returned Wilden.

J will find a way. If they kill me or not, is not important for

me anymore. I only have to get in that zone - this would be

enough", murmured Kohlhaas.

"Well, you could support us with other operations in a much

better way, Frank. Have you ever thought about that?

Operations, that will not end in suicide", Wilden tried to

explain.

„Perhaps! But I have already said it in front of all the men at

the meeting, and now there is no more truning back. But

how?", said Kohlhaas thoughtfully.

„As you may think fit... ", groaned the village boss.

Ill

„lf there is no way to reach this scumbag at the surface,

then I must look for an alternative...?", pondered Kohlhaas.

„But I have just no knowledge about this damn city."

„What do you mean?", Wilden was baffled.

"If I wanted to make such a job in Berlin, my hometown, I

would come through any tunnels, old underground pits or

something like that", said Frank.

„You would find a lot of tunnels in Paris. This city is more

undermined than each anthill, there are probably

innumerable underground entrances, particularly in the

inner part of the city", admitted Wilden.

„Who can give me more informations about this? These two

Frenchmen are nevertheless still here for a few days,

right?", mumbled Frank.

„Well, I hardly believe that they know every tunnel under

Paris. In addition, they are from the north of the country. But

there are construction plans of tunnels and sewers in the

data bases of the administration or on the Internet. You

should ask HOK!

Each official document must also be published in English.

This is a regulation. Thus, you don't even need to be able to

understand French. Just ask HOK! Nevertheless, it's a

completely crazy idea! Either you will get lost in these holes

or they will shoot you. But you will never reach Wechsler!",

prophesied Wilden.

But he just underestimated Frank's imaginativeness and

obstinacy. Only a few hours later, after he had reconsidered

and noted, which weapons and articles of equipment had to

be used for the assassination, Kohlhaas ran to HOK and

forced him to look for some plans of the underground of

Paris.

While Frank passionately told HOK his plans, the computer

expert just groaned, because the young hotspur had

disturbed him during an important work. But then he did

112

Kohlhaas the favour and entered the world of data basesand electronic construction plans. HOK fortunately was aresearcher nature and after approximately half an hour, hewas also fascinated by his new task.It lasted a while, until he had found so informations. Pariswas really more hollowed out than all the other cities inEurope. Meanwhile, about 16 million people lived in themetropolis and the city drowned in its own dirt and stench.Since 1850, when most of the tunnels and thecomprehensive metro system had been built, the old capitalof France stood on a network of mile-long corridors.Already in 2010, the underground system could not beextended anymore, because the workers had already foundold tunnels and holes everywhere .

After the world economic crisis in 2012/13 and during thefollowing years, many metro lines had been closed inconsequence of substantial budget cuts. After 2018, it hadbecome worse, what still annoyed the people of Paris downto the present day.

Today many old underground tunnels were unused and ledinto nowhere. The tunnel system was so enormous, thateven official construction plans could not completely showthe numerous tunnels below the city. Nevertheless, HOKfound some interesting data bases and struggled throughmountains of new informations. The hours passed and thethick man was soon completely absent-minded again.„Until tomorrow, I will search for some nice tunnels andcorridors for you, which will lead you that close toWechslefs speech desk, that you can tickle his feet.If the plans are still relevant at all, I can't say, Frank. And Ican't give you a warranty. Much has changed in the lastyears. Many old, abandoned tunnels and so on...", he saidcasually.

113

Kohlhaas waited for results and already imagined details of

his assassination attempt in his mind.

„Have fun with all these plans, my friend. I will go now.

Thank you!", answered Frank and left HOK's house with a

happy smile.

After approximately one week, HOK and Frank had

prepared a detailed plan, which should lead the rebel

through a tunnel system of almost three kilometers.

The avenue of Paris, which had been called „Avenue de

Champs Elysees" in former times, had been renamed in

„Avenue of Humanity" in 2018, and the triumpal arch, one of

the old landmarks of the city, had been torn down in 2019.

Just as the Eifel tower, which had been dismantled one year

later. In place of the "Arc de Triomphe", the new rulers had

built a modern art building called "Temple of Tolerance", a

giant dark pyramide.

Moreover, the "Avenue of Humanity" had intensively been

converted, whereby many of the old historical houses had

been replaced by concrete buildings of an "unity-look".

After initial protests, the citizens of Paris had become

accustomed to them. They simply had other problems than

worrying about the preservation of old landmarks or houses.

And there were still further plans to separate the city more

thoroughly from its old face, because modern slaves did not

need an own identity or senses of home.

The parade of the GCF occupation troops should take place

on 01.03.2029, at the „Avenue of Humanity", just as other

events to entertain the crowd. A part of the long, old street

would be a fenced off, accessible for nobody. About thirty

meters in front of the thing, called „Temple of Tolerance",

the speaker's plattform, where Leon-Jack Wechsler would

open the ceremonies, should be erected.

The masses, that would fill the streets around the security

zone, should see the politician only on big video screens,

114

which would be set up to hundreds along the "Avenue of

Humanity" and in the whole city.

What was allowed, to be admired from the proximity, were

the GCF soldiers and the policemen, who would

demonstrate strength, marching down the boulevard.

The governor of the administrative sector ..Central Europe"

would bring the "great message of humanity" of the New

World Order, and the parade of the security forces and the

military would show the people, that it was healthier to

believe that message - in case of doubt.

It was a tremendous insanity to go to the dirty metropolis to

kill this polititian. Nevertheless, Frank Kohlhaas bred it in his

mind. He had nothing to lose. It could nothing happen worse

than dying.

115

Procrastination is the Thief of Time!

..Procrastination is the thief of time!"..Procrastination is the thief of time!"..Procrastination is the thief of time!"

Frank still fed his illusion and repeated this slogan like aprayer. In the following days he was just concerned aboutthe fact that he would become scared. But retreat was notallowed anymore, he had to remain hard and Kohlhaas didalso not allow his resoluteness, to get any cracks.„l_eon-Jack Wechsler must die...die...die!", he recitedhimself again and again.

Meanwhile, Alf got out of his way most of the time.Nevertheless, he was fascinated by the idea of creepingthrough tunnels get into the security zone. And sometimeshe even thought about following his crazy buddy to Paris.To kill the governor and to cause riots in one of the mostimportant cities of the continent, was a great chance andcould have sweeping political consequences.Furthermore, the possibility of participating in a "big thing"was offered to him. In this point, he had to agree with Frank.However, he also had nothing to lose and what kind of rebelwould he be, if he bitched out now?

The days passed and Alfred could hardly sleep. Should hereally join the operation? But how? Creeping throughtunnels, then emerging and shooting at Wechsler?That would be their certain death, even if it functioned. Theyjust wouldn't survive this. Escaping from the security zonewould simply be impossible, Alf was sure. He had to talk toFrank, because the plan was still not perfect.

116

The first week of the new month had almost passed and hail

came from the dark sky outside. Frank and Alfred sat in the

kitchen and had a hard day behind them. Kohlhaas had

mused for days and was still not completely content. He had

asked HOK for more construction plans of sewers and other

tunnels below Paris, but he had come to no solution.

Alfred ended the silence. „You have said, we can come to

you, if we want to join the operation, right? Okay, I have

thought about it and came to the decision, not to let you do

this crazy job alone, Frank."

„Aha, this sounds good to me. You really want to help me?",

returned Frank with a smile.

Alfred looked back and said: „More or less, but I need some

more informations about all this. The idea with the sewers

and tunnels seems to be not bad at all and HOK has

already given some plans to you. Did you meanwhile study

them sufficiently?"

„Yes, I did!"

"Anyway, that's not enough!", answered Alf.

„Thus, your plan is to come somehow into the proximity of

that "Temple of Tolerance", through these sewers or

tunnels, right? And then you want to shoot at Wechsler?",

asked Baumerwith surprise.

„About that!", said Frank.

"But you should know, that the entrances to the sewers in

the direct proximity of the event, will all be weld shut by the

police. I think, two or three days before the spectacle",

returned Alf.

Frank recognized that his friend had found a weak point of

his plan: „You are probably right. I already have seen this on

television, in some reports. This could be! Shit!"

„You have to modify your plan. In addition, I don't have the

desire to join a suicide operation. And it would be nothing

else, if we suddenly come out of a hole and shoot at the

117

governor, who is surrounded by countless cops," said

Baumer thoughtfully.

„Maybe you Ye right...", answered Frank and moaned. „Then

make a proposal, Baumer!"

„Hmmm...perhaps..."

Alfred took a slip, on which he had written something. He

hesitated for some seconds and sifted the small note for the

most important details of his plan.

Finally he said: „We go into a channel, a tunnel or

something like that, in the distance of two or three

kilometers - in an insignificant side street, by night.

I have to study HOK's documents. However, we need

something else than an usual handgun, which we couldn't

use at all in the worst case, if the security forces really had

locked all the gully covers around the "Temple of Tolerance"

before the event."

"Get ready with you speech!", said Kohlhaas.

J talk about an explosive charge, that we place under

Wechslefs ass and blow him up in front of the eyes of the

world public. I thought of NDC-23. The stuff is easy to carry

and highly concentrated. Twenty kilograms are sufficient, to

destroy a part of the canal system, the square in front of this

so called "Temple of Tolerance" and of course this fucking

governor!

We could transport it in backpacks into the tunnel system

and bring it to explode below the speaker's platform. Of

course, we will use a time fuse so that we can escape

before the big burst!", explained Alfred and seemed to be

enthusiastic.

„Damn! A great idea!", said Frank and banged on the table.

John or one the others can organize the explosive for us.

Above all, the Russians sell a lot of NDC-23 on the black

market, mostly remnants of the dissolved army of the former

GUS", added Baumer. Frank just smiled and said nothing.

118

..Moreover, we must assume that some tunnel entrances

remain blocked for us, either because workers of the public

utilities are still working there, or because of the security

forces, that had locked them", explained Alf.

Frank scratched his head and cogitated. Alfred's plan

pleased him.

„We need some blowtorchs to open locks or grids, if

necessary", remarked Baumer. „We have a few in the

village here. It is no problem to take them."

..Brilliant!", said Frank enthusiastically.

Alf continued: „And there is one more thing. If they scan the

tunnel system with infrared in the morning before the event,

we should have some cooling covers to cloak ourselves.

John can obtain them. Nevertheless, the whole operation is

really dangerous. We must consider everything!"

..Well, we should go to Wilden, and tell him about our plan.

Perhaps he has some more good ideas", praised Frank his

friend.

Soon after, the village boss evaluated the plan, which had

been introduced to him by both men this time. Julia Wilden,

who stood next to her father, also seemed to be impressed.

Frank smiled at her and enjoyed her admiration.

Still much more had to be done, and next, the men went to

John Thorphy. The Irishman felt disturbed and openly

expressed his displeasure, when the two rebels tried to

send him out to buy the equipment for them. But finally,

Wilden gave him the order to organize the explosive and the

other things.

Where John Thorphy had found the NDC-23, he did not tell.

But it lastet only three days until he returned with over

twenty kilograms of the highly explosive material and gave it

to the two men with a big smile.

..Procastrination is the thief of time!", thought Frank, as he

regarded the plasticine-like mass, packed up in blue bags.

119

His deadly idea slowly took shape, and in his mind healready saw the hated politician torn to pieces on theasphalt in front of the "Temple of Tolerance".His dark, delusional resoluteness couldn't even bedestroyed by sleep disturbances, panic attacks ornightmares anymore. He was eager to bring death to thisman and also to each other person, who would dare tostand in his way. Frank just ignored the fright, that waslurking in the night, and looked forward to the great day ofretribution.

Nothing should ever avert his revenge on this cruel world,as Frank covenanted. Sometimes he went down in the darkcellar, where Alf stored the explosive. All the rooms herewere cluttered with rotten boards and old crates. There wasnot even a light switch. And while his friend slept, the youngrebel crept secretly down the stone stairs and bent over theblue bags, which were sealed with adhesive tape, strokingthem with a dearful smile like a mother her newborn child.

Until middle of February, Frank and Alf spent their time withthe intensive study of construction plans. HOK visited themseveral times, in order to give them still more current anddetailed recordings.

They planned, on recommendation of the computerscientist, to enter the underground labyrinth at the "Avenueof Saint-Ouen", nearly two kilometers away from thesecurity zone.

Here were endless dark tunnels and some of them leaddirectly to the square in front of the "Temple of Tolerance".Nevertheless, the trip to the underworld of Paris wasinsanity. Apart from the fact, that they could not build on thedocuments of the authorities of the city, there was also thepossibility to get lost in the dark corridors. Some tunnels hadbeen closed many years ago, or were just collapsed.

120

Moreover, even the older employees of the cityadministration did not know all the paths through the earthanymore. Further, Frank and Alf didn't want to make theacquaintance of the notorious catacombs of Paris. Thosedark places were a necropolis, as there was no second inEurope.

Here rested the bones of over five million people, who werebrought into the darkness below the city, because of lack ofspace on the cemeteries in the early modern times,.Therefore, the former French capital stood on a giganticgrave field. Alf often talked about these chambers of thedead below the city, which were redundant with bones up tothe ceiling. Frank, who always said that he was not afraid todie, became a bit scared, when he thought about thesespooky places.

„May the dead of Paris forgive us, that we enter their realm.Their brothers in the netherworld, who look complainingdown at this earth, because their life was so earlyterminated by the new rulers, will thank us, if we revengethem!", philosophized Kohlhaas.

However, there was a lot to organize now, far away from allghost stories about catacombs and dark holes in theunderground of Paris. Meanwhile, time pressed.Frank and Alfred should be brought to Compiegne, in thenortheast of Paris, by an airplane, in order to penetrate thecity from there, behaving like harmless tourists. All theplanes in Ivas were registered and had completelyinconspicuous owners. Therefore, this approach seemed tobe clever.

Then, the two assassins wanted to drive from Compiegne toParis with a hire car. Their Scanchips were falsified andsoon they would see, if HOK's abilities had been goodenough. At least, the journey to Paris should start one week

121

before the 01.03.2029, so that enough time remained, to

explore some tunnels in the nights before the event.

The shabby hotel, in which Frank and Alfred should wait for

the great day, had already been chosen by HOK. He had

booked a room for them on the Internet, and had also

contacted the hire car company in Compiegne.

All had to be planned to the smallest detail, because there

was no time to waste and uncertainties could become a

deadly disaster.

The takeoff of the small transport aircraft, which officially

belonged to Mr. Artur Burzius, a Russian insurance buyer,

should start from Ivas on 19.02.2029 at 9.00 o'clock. Then,

the two resistance fighters would enter the lion's den. Still

two days remained. Time was ticking away and Frank had

to admit, despite all frights of the holo cell and the strokes of

fate he had overcome, that he was scared. Scared to death.

Afraid to die soon.

He tried to hide his nervousness, but his whipping with the

foot, when he sat at the kitchen table, and his talking while

he was dozing, betrayed him.

However, his friend felt the same. Alfred mostly ran through

the village in these days, speaking at each possible

opportunity with Wilden, who tried to encourage him.

Sometimes, he sat in the brightly illuminated kitchen during

the whole night, with a cup of tea and a cigarette, just

looking out the window. Baumer did not sleep very much

and waited eargerly for the start of the operation.

Julia is at the door, Frank!", called Alf from the side room,while his roommate tried to concentrate on a politicalbrochure. Dusk was already falling outside. The journey tothe west was set for 9.00 o'clock tomorrow. During this day,many villagers had come to the two men, to wish them allthe best for the operation. Several women had brought

122

cakes and food. Even HOK had visited them again - with

some more construction plans in his hands.

Steffen de Vries, the Belgian, who lived with his family in

Ivas since four years and had to fly the two rebels to

Compiegne, had also been there for several hours.

Meanwhile, de Vries was also more than nervous.

Tm coming!", answered Frank and left his bedroom.

Baumer had already led Julia in and went with her into the

kitchen. She was pleased to see Frank and shook his hand.

„l just wanted to wish you good luck!", she said and seemed

to be concerned and gloomy.

„Thanks! We will need it!", answered Alfred and took a deep

breath.

„Thanks, Julia! It's just nice to see you!", returned Frank.

..However, still a last beautiful sight, before we will enter the

spooky underground."

Now, the pretty woman smiled shyly and didn't find the right

word for a short moment.

J wanted to...", she stammered. „lf it will be too

dangerous...however...and you have no chance to reach

Wechsler, you can always stop the operation!"

Julia stared with her sad eyes at the table surface. Frank

turned to the window and said: „We will see! When we are

in Paris, there will be no more turning back!"

„l meant... ", she added.

„Don't worry! We will be successful, and if not, the

catacombs are near and we will meet a lot of dead buddies",

joked Alf with a cynical undertone.

Julia Wilden obviously found this not very funny and shook

her head. „Don't say such stupid things!", she spoke quietly

and seemed to be close to tears. Kohlhaas enjoyed it, to

see her in such a condition, if he was honest. Now the

beautiful Fraulein, who was always a bit precocious,

showed some feelings.

123

But Frank still played the hard rebel: „We will return for sure,

Julia! We will kill this asshole without mercy!"

Then she said goodbye with tears in her eyes and shook

Baumefs hand. Frank was even hugged by her. He was

pleased that she treated him in such a way, and briefly, he

was nearly inspired. But he checked himself and tried to

think about something else, ignoring the pretty, young

woman.

„She likes you, Franky!", teased him Alf, after Julia had left

the house.

"No idea!", answered his friend with a shake of the head.

"She is really nice!", added Baumer with a broad grin.

Frank turned away from him, went to the window and stared

at the squalid garden behind the house. It was dark and

rainy outside.

The two rebels were still awake for several hours. Now theywere untwisted and nervous. This last night in Ivas, beforethe highly dangerous job in Paris, was terrible for Frank. Hehad weird dreams again, which afflicted him in the shortphase of his sleep during the morning hours. He couldremember just a few things on the next morning, when theFleming, his pilot, awaked him with loud banging and callingat the front door:

Frank walked through a strange dreamworld once more. Itcompletely resembled the holo cell, in which he hadsuffered for eight long months. White, sharp neon light cutinto his eyes and he trudged through the bright fog of lightwithout a real goal.

After a while, he recognized that it was his holo cell, but itappeared much bigger as he could remember. The wallscould not be seen anymore and only the toilet and the hated

124

plank bed with its light-gray pleather stood in the middle of

the white light.

„Frank!", he heard the deep voice of an adult of man from a

distance. „Fraaank!"

He followed the call and soon faced a terrible sight. In front

of him was an enormous spider net, full of thick, black

spiders. Some hatefully stared at him with their glinty eyes,

and their slimy mandibles twitched. Some of the creatures

hissed, when he appeared in front of their net, others were

busy with eating their prey.

The enormous spider net, which seemed to broaden into the

white illuminated sky, was full of screaming humans, who

were clinging to thick and slimy threads.

The young man came closer and saw now, who was in the

claws of the ugly spider monsters. It were babies. It was

Nico. They all were little Nicos. Nevertheless, their voices

did not sound like the voices of babies, they were deeper.

Voices of men, who were already adult.

„Frank! Look at us!", yelled one of the babies, in whose flesh

one of the spiders had bored its mandibles. „Look at us!

Look at us!"

The beasts munched and refreshed themselves with the

warm blood of the little humans, while the babies called: „As

you can see, Frank, the holo cell has grown! Can you see

it? Can you see, how outstanding perfected it is? This cell

does not know walls or borders anymore, because it covers

the whole world. It has been improved greatly, hasn't it?"

And the spiders continued to eat their victims. Soon they

had turned away from Frank again, crept over the gigantic

net and sucked and ate and devoured.

Just look at us, Frank!", chorused the babies. Then it was

again black in the head of the dreamer and he forgot, how

the dream continued...

125

Frank and Alf packed their bags and Steffen de Vries

helped them. Already in this phase of the operation,

mistakes had to be avoided and at first, the list of equipment

was checked off.

Flashlights, explosive, pistols, close combat weapons for

the case of emergency, meal rations, gumboots, army

boots, construction plans of sewers and so on. The list was

long and it lasted over one hour until the three rebels had

finished their work. Before they went to the transport

aircraft, Mr. Wilden suddenly came to them.

„l wish you all the best, my heros!", he called. „Have you

already heard the news today?"

Wilden smiled and was gasping for breath, while Frank, Alf

and the Belgian turned around: „No, we had other

problems!"

Japan!", said the gray-haired man. Japan has left the

World Union! They want their old state back!"

"Aha... ", answered Frank without any interest.

J wanted to tell you that, before you fly away! There were

big demonstrations in Tokyo and in many other cities of the

country, one week ago. Governor Kaito Ikeda, the servant of

the World Government, and his advisor Ron Baldwin, have

resigned and have been expelled from the island. The new

president of Japan is Haruto Matsumoto, the leader of the

reform movement. Japan has moreover stopped all

payments and tributes to the World Government.

Furthermore, all the foreign diplomats and supervisors have

been expelled from the country too. No country has dared a

thing like that since 2018!", explained Wilden with

unconcealed enthusiasm.

Japan is at the end of the world and we are here", returned

Steffen de Vries.

„However, this is nevertheless a sign! The system is

crumbling, my friends. Perhaps, other states will follow

126

Japan!", said the village boss, somehow disappointed that

the three men had not fully understood the meaning of

Matsumoto's rebellion.

Then he added: „lf you read between the lines, beyond the

lies and the agitation of the international media, you could

believe, that even China and Korea are close to a revolt!"

The three rebels, who were waiting for the flight to a deadly

mission, just nodded and said goodbye to Wilden.

Finally the village boss shouted: „You see, nevertheless,

there is still hope! Our fight is not in vain! Good luck!"

At half past ten in the morning, the small airplane rose into

the air. Kohlhaas and Baumer looked wistfully back at the

place of their provisional peace, the village Ivas. Then they

disappeared on the horizon.

Below themselves, they saw the landscape becoming

smaller and soon the plane flew so high, that they could see

the clouds. The hidden and open war, which raged below

them on the ground, seemed to be forgotten for a moment.

But it would not be vanished, when they would come down

to earth again.

They were silent for a while, also the Flemish rebel Steffen

de Vries, Alf and Frank only knew volatilely. The Belgian

lived with his two daughters, his son, his wife and his dog in

the proximity of the village center, in a barely renovated

house.

It was just beautiful, here in the sky, much more pleasant

than on the rotten earth below them. The nervousness in

their minds briefly died down and Frank remembered the

words of Mr. Wilden.

„Japan!", he thought. „This land is far away and has nothing

to do with us. Nevertheless...?"

Perhaps it was a sign of hope, also for the rest of mankind,

that one day the slave chains could be broken again. But it

was so grim. The enemy had become more than superior in

127

this age. The mass media danced his dance of fraud and lie

without exception, and they flew each day new attacks on

the brains of the people, like on cities, which were already

destroyed and still had to be devasteted.

The power of finance, the whole monetary system, was in

the claws of the enemy since a long time. And with this

weapon, he had crushed the world piece by piece.

The military had been bought by him and he sent out his

dull mercenaries, who seemed to have no more own will,

against everyone, who tried to resist him.

What would be in the future? The hangman's noose around

the neck of mankind tigthened with every passing year more

and more. Something had to be done, there was no doubt.

„Japan!", said Baumer with a lack of understanding.

„Wilden, the great analyst of world politics. I don't know,

what I shall think about that."

„ln any case, better than nothing!", it came out of the cockpit

with Flemish accent.

..We'll see what happens now!", answered Frank.

„l will tell you what will happen next!", growled Alf. "Now, the

Lodge Brothers will demoralize these stubborn Japanese.

Slowly but surely. As they always do, if states dare to act

independently.

It will begin with a worldwide press agitation, which will

slander the Japanese to the bone. Then the economic

boycott will come and in the end another war - or the

Japanese will submit to the World Goverment again. That is

an old and proven tactic."

„But it could really be, that other countries will support

Japan", returned Kohlhaas with a tang of confidence.

„No, this is an illusion in my eyes!", answered Alf. ..This new

president, this Matsumoto, should be a born samurai, in

order to endure, what expects him and his people now. He

128

should have nerves like steel cables and should alwayssleep with one eye open."

..Let's hope that he has the spirit of his brave ancestors",said Frank.

Anyhow, Japan's act of restoring its independence, was anincomprehensible boldness from the point of view of theWorld Government. The country had gone through hardtimes since the great crisis in 2013. Its export trade and theindustry had collapsed and the national indebtedness hadbeen so gigantic, that the highly technicalised country hadalmost broken down like a house of cards. The Japanese,who had successfully copied the European technology for along time, had lost their commercial relevance in a fewweeks.

Japan's economy, the cornerstone of its new national prideafter the Second World War, had declined. After 2018, ithad still become worse and the island had turned into abubbling cauldron full of discontent. While a great part of thenationalistic and traditional Japanese population hadpostulated the return to the "old way", the care for theirculture and the preference of Japanese interests, thepuppet government of Kaito Ikeda, who had been assignedby the World Government, had done the opposite. So thetensions had risen with time.

Steffen de Vries switched on the digitized radio and a songof the Cyberpop Hipcore star Evan Steele resounded out ofthe cockpit, which soon got on Frank's and Alf's nerves.Then the news followed.

First came a message about the World President, who hadopened an „One-World-Kindergarten" in Washington, tellingthe listeners, that inattentiveness or rebellious behavior,particularly among little boys, had to be fought with newdrugs. Early childhood disturbances had to be wiped out by

129

the use of more pharmaceutical products and it was a holyassignment for all great humanists, to liberate the childrenof the world from these "diseases".

The chief of the kindergarten was asked about this andseemed to be enthusiastic about the new medicines. Then arepresentative of a big pharmaceutical company gave aninterview and announced that they intensively worked on anew drug programs for infants.

The next topic was Japan and the newscaster said: „Thismorning, the World Government discussed furthermeasures at their crisis meeting in New York, to handle withthe fascist Japanese state.

The World President and other prominent representatives ofpolitics and economics, came to the decision, that the globalcommunity has to consider drastic measures, because ofthe increasing threat to all peaceable people. Matsumoto'sJapan, where political dissidents are persecuted andmurdered, has nuclear weapons and seems to be willing, touse them against the free world, as secret GSA reportsprove.

The governor of the administrative sector ..Eastern Asia",Mr. Kim Bo-Hung, and his advisor Mr. David Frost,announced a hard course against Japan during theconference.

„We can not permit, that fascist polititians like HarutoMatsumoto become new cancerous ulcers in our peacefuland free world!", stressed the World President literally.GCF commander Edward McOwen said that a possiblesecurity zone has to be established around Japan andarranged the sending of warships of the GCF Pacific fleet toEastern Asia. He exhorted all administrative districts andsub-sectors of the world community to watchfulness, inorder to make fanatics and dictators like Matsumotoinnocuous, before they become too powerful. The plan of

130

Japan, to become independent from world economy, andalso the intend to abolish the interest system, the WorldPresident castigated as a ..perverse act of a mad gonedictatorship".

..What did I say?", muttered Baumer and smiled sufferingly.„Now it starts!"

„We can only wish the Japanese good luck for the future. Ihope, they have a thick skin. Now we have our own fight!",replied Frank.

The airplane flew over Poland and came nearer to thesector ..Central Europe", while time passed. Meanwhile, thethree men were seized by a growing nervosity.They talked quietly with each other, as if they would fear tobe intercepted by an enormous ear in the sky. And actuallythe curious ears and eyes around them became morenumerous. The countless radar and alarm systems,supervising the airspace, let Frank think of the spider net inhis nightmare. ..Central Europe" was near.But nothing happened. Nobody noticed the inadvertentguests, who penetrated the completely supervised area. Ifsomeone had really scanned the flier, he had only found aninsignificant name in the registration card index of themachine. The big eye looked past them, although they weredirectly in front of its pupil. The hours passed and Frank,Alfred and Steffen breathed again, when they crossed theold border of France and no radiogram of the air trafficcontrol was sent. Compiegne was close now and theairplane started its final descent.

Finally, they reached the ground without incidents, but afeeling of biggest uncertainty tormented them, when theystepped out of the airplane. It was like in former times, whenthe Europeans could still afford vacation travels to thesouthern countries. If they had left the cold north and had

131

finally come out of the plane in the south, they had oftenbeen confronted with an unusual wall of stifling heat. Todayit was different, because the wall, which waited for Frankand Alf here in the center of France, was not made of heat,it consisted of distrust.

In his meticulous fashion, HOK had selected a small village,where there rebels should land. Far away from the attentionof the natives.

The Belgian had opted a large field near the village to land.Frank and Alf said goodbye and took their backpacks. Thende Vries took off again as fast as he could.For safety reasons he flew directly back to Ivas, because hedidn't want to stay just one minute longer in such anextremely monitored zone. If he would have parked hisplane somewhere in this rural area for seven days, thedanger to be controlled by a police patrol would still havebeen small, but his nerves were raw.He had been relieved, when he had left the sector "CentralEurope" with his Family in 2019 - never to be seen again.Perhaps, de Vries was a little too paranoid, and he also hada perfectly falsified Scanchip, but only the thought of beingcaught by the police filled him with panic. The Fleming hadalready been arrested in 2011, because of smuggling arms,and his name was still listed in all official databanks. Steffenand his family had suffered a lot in "Central Europe" andwhen he finally came back to Ivas, he was more than happyabout this.

Meanwhile, Frank and Alf stood on a field close to a smallvillage near Compiegne - with full backpacks. Their heartswere pounding like mad. Now they were on their own,standing in the middle of enemy country. Therefore, it wasimportant to behave inconspicuous.„We look like ramblers from the forest", muttered Alf.

132

..Let's go to the village and then we will drive to Compiegne

by bus. We still have to make it to Paris today!", explained

Frank and felt uneasy.

They walked along a dusty road, which led from the landing

zone directly to the small village, always looking around.

The load was heavy, everyone had to carry about 25

kilograms, and they just hoped that no policeman would find

them strange.

However, the two rebels had some ordinary clothes. Frank

wore some blue jeans and a dark green polo. Furthermore,

a light gray baseball cap, which was pulled deeply into his

face, covering his head.

Baumer also wore blue jeans, a brown turtleneck pullover

and a reddish baseball cap with the symbol of the the

"Cleveland dead Indians". Under the trouser legs of the two

men, black army boots could be seen, because firm

footwear was essential on this mission.

Their warm jackets had been stowed in the backpacks.

They also had sunglasses in their bags, but the weather

was sulky today, and so sunglasses would have looked not

very inconspicuous.

On the way to the village, they didn't see many people. Just

an old man, who passed and briefly examined them. Apart

from this, there was not a soul to be seen. However, the

village didn't pulsate of life. Everything looked poorly and

only a few inhabitants were on the street. Just a little boy on

the opposite roadside, who shouted something in French,

gave them a bit attention. But Frank and Alf didn't mind him.

They went to a bus stop and drove with line 38 to

Compiegne.

..Just cut and run!", they thought to themselves. The bus

driver had warily looked at them, when he had debited the

amount for the trip from their Scanchips, Frank was sure.

Alfred, however, protested that this hadn't been noticeable

133

to him. Both were silent and tried to ignore the otherpassengers. They just sat in the last row of seats of the busand were glad about everyone, who did not turn around tothem. The bus driver talked with an older woman during thetrip, and she probably told him her whole life story with wildgestures. „Oui!" and „Non!" it resounded through the shabbybus. Then the vehicle arrived at Compiegne.

„Give me the DC-stick!", said Frank, after they had steppedoff the bus.

Anyhow they had already taken this small hurdle withoutany problems. Alfred ransacked his black backpack andpulled out a small data medium. On the DC-stick were theconstruction plans of the canalization of Paris and otherfiles, also a map of Compiegne.

„We are here, in the center. The rental car company is notfar away. We can walk!", said Frank and nervously looked atAlf.

Now they were surrounded by a lot of people. It was not likein the small village they came from. The two assassins wereclose to a shopping mile and masses of passersby were allover the place. But they didn't regard them, if at all only astourists, and gave them no closer looks. Both men heard atangle of languages beyond their ears, mainly French.Some children, probably Arabs, ran over the street andwere screamed. At first sight, Compiegne was an ugly, grayand dirty city. At second sight, it was still more disgusting!The shopping mile was full of beggars and homelesspeople, who hung around in the corners, wrapped in coversand drunk. An old man roared loudly with a babbling voiceand threw his bottle of cheap liquor on the asphalt.Somewhere, someone tried to play on a guitar and sang flatto get some Globes. It was just odious here. But where wasit still pleasant in this age? Anyhow, Kohlhaas and Baumer

134

hit the road immediately to reach the rental car company intime. It was already after 17.00 o'clock and they had tohurry up.

Frank noticed that the people around him walked with astoop, as if they would have an interest to look like midgets.Their faces reflected poverty, many looked ill and pale. Thetwo Germans were regarded by nobody and silently walkeddown the street. Shortly afterwards, they passed someabandoned shops. Probably there had been a flourishingretail trade in former times, but this was long ago.Meanwhile, the shopwindows of the dirty houses in thecenter of Compiegne looked dead and dusty. The downfallof a once beautiful city was obvious.

What had remained, were the cheap supermarkets of„Globe Food" and „3X6 Market", which supplied Europe andNorth America with their bad food.

Here, the homeless people clustered. They gestured,shouted, brought new liquor out of the supermarket and alsovomited, when they were drunk enough. From the other endof the long shopping street, which had already lost its gloss,suddenly came a loud scream. A young man had stabbedone of the derelicts, people ran around and started to yell.Frank and Alfred walked faster, if a police car emerged.A little later, they had reached the rental car company,which lay in a halfdark backyard. A sturdy man with a beardwaited for them behind a desk and lolled on his chair. Thetwo rebels entered his office. Now it became thrilling,because Frank had to use his falsified Scanchip for the firsttime.

„We want a car. We want to go to Paris!", said Alfred.

The Frenchman, who probably had a lot of contact with

tourists, looked up and fetched some papers.

135

„Oui! You want to go to Paris? Okay!", he answered and

smiled.

„Eh... Yes!", added Frank. „Which car do you want? A

normally car, a combi, a van?", enumerated the renter.

„Normal car!", answered Alf.

„Which type?", asked the man.

„Tell that asshole that it is all the same to me. I want to

leave this place as fast as I can!", hissed Kohlhaas quietly.

Alf nodded.

„lt doesn't matter. Any normal car!", said Baumer.

„Okay! Where are you from?", nerved the Frenchman.

„Austria...from Austria!", stammered Frank. His heart

pounded and his hands felt sweaty.

„Ah! Aus Osterreich!", joked the man and tried to talk

German.

„Ja!", answered Alfred.

The renter stood up from his chair and waved the two rebels

nearer.

„Come on!", he called. „Here! This car you can have."

The friendly man showed Frank and Alf a black and no

longer new "Lion".

„ls der gut?", he asked, grinned and was pleased that he

had made it, to speak German.

„Yes! We take this car!", answered Frank, whose back

began to hurt, because of his heavy load.

„Okay, we go to the office. Than pay with Scanchip!", said

the renter and walked off.

"Now we will see...", whispered Alf.

„How long do you want to lease the car?", asked the man

from the next room and typed something.

„Till the second of march!", said Alf.

"Okay!", it came back.

The Frenchman took the two Scanchips and pulled them

over a reader.

136

„A car is 40 Globes a day, my friends!", he explained.

„Okay!", breathed Frank and looked at Alf with fear in his

eyes.

The reader hummed quietly and for the two men the world

seemed to stop turning for some seconds. The tension let

their hearts pump faster and the adrenalin shot through their

veins.

Then the Frenchman looked up and smiled friendly: „Thank

you, Mr. Eberharter and Mr. Willner. Take your car. Have

much fun in Paris! Haben Sie vielen Spaft in Paris, mein

Herren! Ha, ha!"

The two rebels took a deep breath, walked fastly to their

car, threw the heavy bags into the trunk and disappeared.

The trip to Paris was more pleasant than in former times.There were no more traffic jams of considerable size,because the number of cars had increasingly been reducedin the last years.

The breakdown of the automobile industry had begun in theyear 2009 and in 2029, cars were luxury articles for theordinary people. Who could hardly ensure, that there wasenough food on his plate, had no more Globes to fund a car.Government officials and other higher earners, who stillcould afford a car, were an exception. Moreover, the pricesfor gasoline had drastically risen, particularly since 2018.Meanwhile, a car devoured big sums of money.Alternative energies, which could have replaced thegasoline, were still suppressed by the oil industry and the oillords had still all the power, to exterminate any rivals in thissector. In 2019, a worldwide wave of liquidations by theGSA had hit many scientists and entrepreneurs, whowanted to offer free energies. So the traffic jams slowlyvanished, and that was a real advantage on this day,because the two rebels could nearly "enjoy" their trip to

137

Paris. However, the motorways and streets were in acatastrophic condition. The administrative district ..CentralEurope" used its income for more important things than torepair streets, for example, an improved monitoring or anextended armament.

It lasted for a while, until the two men had found the hotel,which HOK had chosen for them. The streets of Parisappeared endlessly and darkly, and if one didn't know thislabyrinth of lanes, it was easy to go astray.The hotel was called ..Sunflower" and was in the east ofParis. At 20,30 o'clock, the exhausted men finally arrivedand parked their car behind the buidling. In the hotel, apretty Frenchwoman with light brown hair and a girlish facewas waiting for them.

She was very friendly, but somehow busy and reticent.However, this was no problem, because unnecessary talkwith other people had to be strictly avoided. Frank and Alfjust told her, that they were tourists from Austria.The Scanchips functioned perfectly again. This was the wayit should be. Then, the two men brought their heavy andexplosive luggage to room 16 on the 2nd floor. Frank andAlf didn't see many other guests on this evening. Only anolder woman, who greeted them in French. That was all.They closed the door behind themselves and fell on theirbeds, which were covered with a brown duvet. Soon thisday had come to an end and the two rebels were just gladabout this.

Now they were in Paris, but the real trip to hell was stillwaiting for them. Nevertheless, Frank and Alf banished thisfact from their minds at this evening.

139

Although they were in the middle of a strongly monitoredcity in ..Central Europe", and the enemy could lie in wait ateach corner, Frank and Alf slept quite well. At first, Frankremembered this old French song, which was occasionallyplayed on the radio. He changed the text of the Germanversion in a way that it was suitable to the situation.Kohlhaas chuckled quietly, till the sleep had overpoweredhim.

The beginning of the next day could not be avoided andthere were only eight days till the "Festival of the newWorld", which should come over the old "Avenue deChamps-Elysees".

There was still enough time to get an idea of the situation,and to explore the dark sewer tunnels, which they hadselected as their way to the security zone. This procedurewas also very necessary, because there was no room intheir plan for unexpected incidents, collapsed tunnels orblocked ways.

Frank and Alf spent the first day in Paris in their hotel roomand avoided to leave the building. Only once, Alf boughtsomething to eat in a nearby supermarket and told his friendabout the dirty streets he had walked down. Apart from that,they spent their time with watching TV. The news, whichwere mostly agitation against Japan, brought them severaloutbreaks of rage. For the next day, more exactly for thenext night, both men had planned something really bold. Attwo o'clock in the morning, the two rebels sneaked out oftheir hotel room and passed the abandoned reception.In the darkness of the next street corner, Frank hastily tookhis DC-Stick and opened the city map of Paris, which HOKhad completed with additional informations. Like twoshades, they crept around the houses and moved silentlyfrom one dark place to the next. It was raining and Alfsuggested to postpone the operation to the following day,

140

but Frank did not want to waste anymore time and remainedstubborn. „The Rue Lagille, it is not far away from here!",whispered Kohlhaas and showed his friend the map.„We are just crazy, man!", answered Baumer.„Of course!" Frank grinned. „And now, let's hurry up!"They went to a dark corner again and studied someconstruction plans. Meanwhile, the heavy rain had stoppedand just dabbled quietly one the roofs of the houses aroundthem. The streets were empty, only a few probably Algerianteenagers, who occasionally roared through the night orkicked against garbage cans and bus stop signs, could beseen in the distance. However, the two rebels were notnoticeable to them. It was after three o'clock, when theyfinally reached their goal.

..Let's look for an entrance here", whispered Frank.„Shit, what am I doing here?", sighed his friend and fetcheda small crowbar, which he kept hidden under his jacket...Come on now!", hissed Kohlhaas.

A car drove past them and an old woman, standing at abrightly illuminated window, gazed at the dark and wetstreet. Frank and Alf had noticed her and decided to creepinconspicuously away.

..Look! She can see us! We have to go!", growled Frank andAlf followed him.

..Let's go to the next street, there are only some houses onone side. And there is an abandoned factory building,according to the plan", whispered the young man with theDC-Stick in his hand.

Shortly afterwards, they reached a nearly perfect dark backalley. Now they felt unobserved. Anyhow, they could not seeanybody, although they looked around several times andexamined the environment with sharp eyes. A minute laterthey stood in front of a gully cover of iron. It was clearly

141

visible shown on one of HOK's maps of the city of Paris.

They paused for a short moment.

„This must be gully cover 344-GL-77003, if the map is

correct", said Frank with a little enthusiastic face. „Down

there? Now? Damn!"

„No turning back, Kohlhaas!", answered Alf and already

screwed up his nose.

They lifted the manhole cover without problems and pushed

it to the side. In front of them, an unfathomable black hole

opened itself now. Only the outlines of some rusty rungs,

leading into the darkness, could be recognized.

„Fuck!", said Frank.

Baumers nodded approvingly, then he held his flashlight

downward. Dirt, rotten leaves and rust expected the two

assassins down below. Moreover, a pungent stench.

"Oh my God!", said Kohlhaas and took his rubber glovesand the breathing mask. "Do you have the blowtorch, Alf?""Yes, sure! What are you waiting for?", muttered Baumer.Frank carefully climbed down the rusty ladder, while Alf wasshining for him. After a few minutes, he had reached theground.

„Baaah!", it resounded out of the dark hole.His partner could imagine, what Frank meant. ThenKohlhaas shone for Alf, who crawled down into theunknown, little inviting environment of the underground ofParis. Baumer pulled the gully cover over the manhole, sothat only a small gap remained. Down here, it was asdisgusting as expected, and the channel did not make theimpression, as if someone had ever cleaned it in the lasttwenty years. Wet heaps of dirt were piled up beside therivlet, down to the feet of the two men. Some rats scurriedaway. Alf shone at them with his flashlight and the animalsquickly disappeared somewhere in a stinking hole.

142

„l_ook at this, gentlemen of the World Government are also

here!", joked Frank and pointed at the rats.

Alf chuckled. „Here will be a lot of them. If you see a

completely fat and bloated rat, then you can address it with

„Mr. World President"!"

Frank grinned and returned: „To compare these poor

animals with the Lodge Brothers, is an insult for every rat!"

The gossip took a bit of the uncertainty of the two rebels,

who stood now in the middle of an ugly sewer tunnel. Frank

looked at his map again and then they walked about

hundred meters straightforward.

They had to watch out for their heads, because the tunnel

was not as tall as a man and surely already very old. Soon

after, both men came to a bigger canal and heard a car

above themselves. They were under a street. The little river

of wastewater was a bit broader here, just like the roundish

tunnel. Now they had to come to a decision.

„lf the map is correct, we must go to the left", said Frank

after a short look at the DC-Stick.

„lt will hopefully be correct, otherwise we are fucked up",

grumbled Baumer.

„There is always a gully cover somewhere, that can bring us

back to the surface", said Frank and walked forward, waving

with his flashlight. Meanwhile, Alfred sprayed a red cross on

the wall, in order to use it later as an orientation.

The broader sewer tunnel still extended for about two

hundred meters, then they came to a grid, clogged with dirt

and leaves, which was completely rusted. There was no

getting through. At least, not without a blowtorch, which

Alfred fortunately had. It just took a quarter of an hour, then

he had destroyed the rusty lattice.

„What a work!", gasped Alf, when the dammed up water

poured away between his legs with loud splashing.

143

The tunnel with the old grid still extended for two hundredfurther meters, then it ended in a larger room, where the rillsof wastewater flowed together. Gray-green walls gazed atthe two intruders and Frank was sure, that these oldbuildings already existed since many decades, maybe sincecenturies.

Rusty wastewater pipes came from the ceiling of the roomand on the wall was a sign with something in French on it. Itwas completely rusted too.

At least, they could stand tall here. The way forked again inseveral directions. Frank looked at some files and was surethat they had to go into the opposite tunnel, Alfred trustedhim and sprayed another red cross on the wall.„One of these sewer corridors had not been on our map, butthis must be the right one! Above it, is the "Rue deRothschild", as I think", explained Kohlhaas.Shortly afterwards, they walked through a narrow passagewith some big holes in the walls. Spiders and rats welcomedthem in this dark tunnel and it was smelling rancidly, despitethe breathing masks.

Frank and Alf had to crouch again and watched their heads.Meanwhile, they had walked this tunnel for about fiftymeters, when they discovered a small source of light abovethemselves. Probably it was the light of one of the streetlamps, which came through a little hole of a gully cover.They continued to creep through the stinking passage, thenthey stopped. A black water lode with a very narrowsidewalk on the side was in front of them, it wasapproximately one meter deep. In the distance of tenmeters, rusty and damaged iron pipes led upward. Alfredmarked the way and followed his friend along the stream.The water was not really deep, but it smelled foul andappeared somehow threatening. Frank thought that aterrible kraken would grab them with its tentacles to pull

144

them down into a bottomless black sea. It was just spooky

down here and the stench crept out of every corner right

into their noses.

„lf I have counted my steps correctly, we have walked about

600 or 700 meters yet", said Baumer.

His friend looked at the digital map and nodded. At the end

of the tunnel, they reached a relatively big room, which

looked like a reservoir. Stairs led upward and a large pool

with brackish water was in front of them.

Frank illuminated the basin, then he said to Alfred: ..HOK's

informations have mostly been correct so far. This reservoir

or whatever it is, has been marked with a red spot on the

map. You should spray a sign on the wall here!"

After they had crossed the next tunnel, they had penetrated

the underground labyrinth for more than one kilometer.

Then they reached an area, which reminded them of a small

hall. It must have been a part of the world-famous

canalization of Paris, which had been built in the year 1850

and during the following period. With a tang of admiration,

the two men stopped for a moment and looked around.

Then they continued their journey.

„This must be pumps over there, right?" Alfred pointed at

several enormous pipes with big handwheels on the side,

that led into a deep water reservoir. However, they also

were totally rusted, although they seemed to be still in use.

J think so!", answered Frank. „This hall is probably in the

east of the "Avenue of Humanity". I think the street is less

than two kilometers far from here. This place is noticeable

enough, we don't need to mark it."

Alfred put the spray can with the red color back into his

backpack and followed his friend. They went up some

concrete stairs with a handrail on the side. Then they

entered big room, that nearly looked like an underground

hall and was carried by stone columns. Soon after, Frank

145

and Alf went to the right and walked through a narrow, long

passage.

..HOK's informations have been right yet", said Kohlhaas.

„The construction plans of the canalization of the inner city

seem to be still exact."

„Well, the World Government has just taken over this

ancient and singular sewerage. They would never build

something for the people!", remarked Alf.

„This sewer network has been built by hardworking men and

not by dirty parasites!", hissed Frank and waved his friend

nearer.

„Look! There is a locked door. It obstructs the way, which

we have to take", said Frank and pointed at a dark corner of

the hall. Alfred fetched his blowtorch, but didn't destroy the

door more than necessary, in order to arouse no suspicion.

The tunnel beyond the locked door seemed to be endless,

and after a while the two men discovered a hole in the wall.

But there was no sewer corridor anywhere.

„What is that? It looks, as if somebody had broken some

stones out of the wall there, to dig a way", said Frank and

illuminated the strange hole with his flashlight. „Over there!

Look, there is another tunnel! Can you see it?"

Behind the hole seemed to be a large shaft. In the last

years, many homeless people had revamped the

underworld of Paris at their own discretion and had

extended the endless tunnel system. They had found a sad

home here, in a time, when there was no more room for

them at the surface. Kohlhaas looked at his DC-stick and

read some files. It lasted nearly half an hour. In the

meantime, Alfred sauntered boredly and nervously through

the darkness.

„This could be an abandoned metro shaft!", explained

Frank.

146

„ln the inner city of Paris, the sewer corridors, tunnels andpassages are sometimes hardly ten meters away from eachother. I will take a closer look!"

Alfred already saw the back of his friend, who jumped intothe little cavity and soon shone with the flashlight in hisdirection. Kohlhaas called him out of the dark tunnel andseemed to be excited.

„Come on!", he whispered. J can see tracks. You see, I wasright!"

Baumer also crept through the hole and the two menfollowed the tracks. Perhaps they could find an abbreviation,if this metro shaft was really the marked path on HOICsmap.

It lasted a while, because the abandoned tunnel extendedover several hundred meters. Suddenly they heard a gaspsomewhere in the darkness. They twinced and turnedaround, looking in all directions. The vein in Frank's templebegan to pound and also Alfred nervously brandished hisflashlight.

The gasp could be heard again and the two rebels searchedfor the source of noise. Finally they saw a man, who lay in adark corner. Probably a derelict, old and ugly, with a reddishbeard, a shabby trench coat and some brandy bottles infront of him. The underground inhabitant blinked dazedly,when Baumer hit him with the blaze of his flashlight.„Ca va?", slurred the old man."What?", stammered Frank nervously."Ca va?", repeated the drunk. "Ca va?""All right, grandpa! We will go now!", said Alf and turnedaround."Ca va?"

„Shut the fuck up, man!", hissed Frank toward the tramp andpulled his gun.

147

"Frank, what do you...?", asked Baumer. „Put that gun

away!"

„lf he tells someone that we have been down here or

remembers our faces...", growled Frank excitedly and

brandished his weapon.

„This guy is just drunk. Leave him alone! Or do you want to

kill him?", grumbled Alf at his friend.

"Ca va?", burped the tramp again.

"Shut up, you dirty old jerk! Don't make such a noise!

Otherwise I will give you some „Ca va"!", screamed Frank

and kicked the man in the side.

The tramp whined quietly and whispered something in

French. Kohlhaas pressed the pistol against his nose. "Just

shut up, man! Or you won't survive this!"

At this moment, Alfred pulled the furious young man

energetically back and shoved him away.

„What is wrong with you, Frank? Are you mad? That old guy

will say nothing. Hundreds of homeless people hang around

here and nobody is interested in the babble of an old tramp!

Let's go back through the tunnels! It's time to disappear!"

Frank slowly calmed down and put his gun away. He had

nearly shot or stabbed this old man. Alfred gave him

another stroke in the side and looked at him with lack of

comprehension.

„lt's enough for now!", he said. ..Otherwise, I will become

angry! We disappear from here! Come on!"

Frank just followed his friend and was silent. At once, the

whole thing was embarrassing to him and Alfred

reprimanded him again, with sharp words, to control his

rage next time. „He was nevertheless nothing but a drunk

grandpa, man!", he grumbled.

„Okay, I may have overreacted...", answered Frank and

looked away.

148

When they went back and crept again through the darksewer system, Frank had to admit himself, that he had beenclose to kill this bum. That he was a safety risk, couldperhaps be an argument, but only a superficial, because itwas more than improbable that anybody would beinterested in the twaddle of a drunk tramp from theunderground of Paris.

Nevertheless, he had almost killed this man, simply cut histhroat, to let him rot in the darkness of the old metro shaft.Yes, it had almost happened, if Alfred had not stopped him.Frank thought about himself...

Frank and Alf did not continue to explore the abandonedtunnel, in which the drunk man had lain. They crept againback through the hole and Kohlhaas took his DC-stick out ofthe backpack. Meanwhile, the two men were tired and Parisseemed to wake up above them. The honking of cars andthe rumble slowly became louder.

„lt probably goes on here. After the next two passages thereis another room with reservoirs - or whatever!", explainedFrank and went into the next tunnel.

Alfred sprayed a red cross on the wall beside the hole,which led into the metro shaft and followed his easilyexcitable rebel friend.

They still walked through stinking, but this time bigger sewercorridors, that had small and smelly rivers inside. Baumerlooked at Frank's back and was still annoyed. Meanwhile,they had advanced still deeper into the underground. Finallythey found a second underground hall, which was also holdby stone columns. The wastewater was collected here inlarge basins and was moreover rerouted in severaldirections. The basins were covered with large grids of ironand there was a footpath with some stairs, that was securedwith a banister rail. Here one could probably come to a

149

control room. Several water pumps and pipes were all

around them. On the walls, they recognized lamps and thick

cables. Also some crates had been piled up there. This

large and long room seemed to be used very often, because

it was directly below the inner city. But around this time it

was empty. The two men crept further forward.

The old brick walls and the stone archs had something

formidable. Now they recognized some iron stairs, which led

up the wall and ended in a dark hole. At the end of the hall,

there was a rusted steel door with a lamp above it.

„Look at this enormous room! It had already been built in the

good old times. Really impressing!", whispered Alfred.

"Yes, a very big hall below the earth. Like the old „Moria" in

that film. Just smaller...", said Frank.

„Moria?", asked Baumer and was puzzled. „What do you

mean with that?"

„Well, there is an old fantasy film. My father had once

brought me a video tape, when I was still a little boy. It was

called „The Lord of the Rings". In that movie, the heroes had

to pass an underground labyrinth too - and it was called

„Moria". An giant underground city, built by the dwarves in

the ancient times of Middle-earth...", described Kohlhaas. „l

really loved that film!"

„You are a dwarf too, ha, ha!", answered Alf and smiled.

„Where are we here?"

A look at the map seemed to be necessary now. Probably

the steel door at the end of the vault led into a bigger area,

from where the men could reach the "Avenue of Humanity".

J hope that there will be no workers of the public utilities",

whispered Alfred. It was already after five o'clock in the

morning. „We must hurry up!"

"Maybe the workers are more often here, than in the areas

behind us", answered Frank quietly.

150

The steel door was secured with a digital code lock. Apartfrom that, the door looked old and was strongly rusted. Thedark green paint on its surface had already peeled. Alfredstarted working immediately. He used his blowtorch, but thedoor was very solid.

Baumer had to destroy a big part of the lock and needednearly half an hour to open it. Meanwhile, Frank lookednervously around and hoped that nobody would disturbthem.

Finally, the steel door opened with a quiet crunch and thetwo assassins came into another room, which was equippedwith some shelves and an electronic control desk. The olddesk reminded them of the seventies of the last century,because of its design. It was a true relict of technology.Soon after, they left the area over some stone stairs andsneaked over a way with deep water reservoirs at the sides.Finally they disappeared again in one of the sewer tunnels,because Frank believed, that he had found this passage onHOK's map. Alf marked the way and they continued withtheir search.

„The "Avenue of Humanity" is no longer far!", calledKohlhaas and disappeared into another dark hole.They walked about hundred meters straightforward andturned then to the left into a further sewer corridor. Again, itwas one of the bigger tunnels, because a small river rushedbeside them here. Now they saw numerous cables, rustylamps, old pipes and also a faded sign with some warnings.A little later, both men stood in front of the next grid, whichblocked their way. Alfred's blowtorch cut through the rustymetal and he threw a glowing piece of the grid into thewater. After further hundred meters, a rat swarm, which hadprobably held a meeting here, fled from the blaze of theirflashlights in all directions. Then the old brick ceilings

151

became higher and they reached a hall with an enormouswater pump and a large basin in its center.While the two rebels felt safe in the narrow and dark sewercorridors, which led through the underground of Paris, theyhad the impression of being observed in the larger roomsand halls.

Here they could have encountered another derelict or aworker of the public utilities. But it was still very early in themorning and nobody, except for the two rebels, seemed tobe here. From a distance, they suddenly heard thethundering of an arriving metro. That was a good sign.„Charles de Gaulle!", whispered Frank and leaned against alarge, gray column. „lt must be the underground stationCharles de Gaulle. It is close to the "Temple of Tolerance".We have almost reached our goal!"

The two men looked at the map again, then they climbeddown an iron ladder and disappeared into a larger tunnel,which led them towards the source of noise. The waythrough this passage was long, monotonous and stinky. Itseemed to lead many hundred meters into nothing. Frankreassured Alf that it was no longer far.Only one last sewer corridor had to be passed now. Thenthey would be directly below the square, that had once beendecorated by the Arc de Triomphe. Again, they heard thenoise of a metro, speeding through the earth. The tworebels had crept through the guts of Paris with success.Frank and Alf were proud.

Beside them, a rusty ladder led upward to a dirty gullycover, where armies of black spiders were waiting for them,as a closer look proved. A little later it was done. The"Temple of Tolerance" was directly above their heads. Carswere humming and honking on the heavily travelled street,and they heard some people shout. Paris awoke.

152

Now it was time to disappear. Frank jumped up the ladder

like a cat, climbed upward and lifted the gully cover to look

over the square. Frank smiled grimly. They had finally made

their way through the canalization - it was possible!

From the corner of his eye Kohlhaas could recognize an

outside wall of the ugly concrete monument, that looked like

a huge pyramid.

"We have arrived! Great!", said Frank joyfully and climbed

down the ladder again.

"Over there! Look! About thirty meters away from me!"

Alfred pointed at the darkness of the sewer corridor next to

him. "We will place the bomb there and send Wechsler to

hell! The explosion will be strong enough to tear up a big

part of the square in front of the monument!"

"Yes! We will fucking do that!", muttered Frank with a

poisonous smile.

"And now we have to move our asses out of this

canalization!", he added and both men headed back. With

growing internal confidence and contentment, the two rebels

slunk off.

Occasionally, Frank had to study some construction plans

again, but mostly his sense of direction was right. The red

crosses, Alfred had sprayed on the walls, were a good

additional help. Perfectly tired, stinky and filthy, they finally

crept out of the sewer tunnel next to the abandoned factory

hall in the early morning hours. Soon they would spend

many hours in the canalization again.

On their way back to the hotel, at dawn, no one noticed

them. Indeed their clothes were dirty, but this was not

unusual in Paris. There were a lot of filthy guys in the

streets of this metropolis. A warm hotel room was waiting for

them and it was silent on the unlit floor. They just closed the

door behind them and looked forward to a hot shower.

Frank and Alf had no longer had this luxury since years, and

153

both enjoyed the water, washing all the dirt and the stenchaway from their bodies. Then they quickly fell asleep. Soonthe great day would come. The day of bloody revenge. AndFrank looked forward to his payback...

154

The Lull before the Storm

Frank and Alfred left the small hotel ..Sunflower" in the

following days always alternating, in order to buy some food

in the nearby supermarkets. They never ate in the small

dining room of the hotel together with the other guests and

avoided every contact to them. Only in their hotel room, they

took their meals, which were usually produced by the

"Globe Food" grocery chain.

The television was on, all day long, and overwhelmed them

with dull entertainment and repetitions of old movies,

interrupted by the hourly news. In this context, it was

interesting to see, how the World Government dealt with the

renegade state of Japan. At an interval of a few hours, the

newest reports came over the air.

Japanese were interviewed, who allegedly had left the

country, ..before Matsumotos firing squads could execute

them", because they had fought for ..world peace" and

"freedom". Ron Baldwin, the not very trustworthy looking

advisor of puppet governor Ikeda, who had also been blown

off the country, appeared in nearly each newscast.

He whined and stressed his ..great sorrows about the new

Japan", that he had learned to love soo much, since he had

come to the island in 2020, as a manager of the Greenbaum

Brothers Bank

He tried to look dismayed and affected to convince even the

ignorant viewers. Nevertheless, it was his job to lie in front

of the telecameras and he seemed to be eager to play his

role.

Eight great warships had been sent to the eastern seas of

Japan by the GCF high command, in order to observe the

situation. Furthermore, the World President had demanded

155

an ultimatum to the island people. They had to return to the

World Union until the end of the month.

"Otherwise, unpleasant consequences for the Matsumoto

regime could follow!", he threatened on television.

The media concealed that the new president of Japan had

come to power by the will of his people. He had been voted

by over eighty percent of the Japanese population.

Meanwhile, the Japanese had abolished any further

elections, and Matsumoto called democracy a "giant play of

mass manipulation".

Moreover, the new president controlled himself and let all

representatives and ambassadors of the World Government

leave the country. And Matsumoto did not lay a finger on

them.

However, during the rebellion it had come to spontaneous

lynchings by the furious people. Some Japanese had just

taken revenge on those persons, who had exploited them

for many years and had destroyed their country. The most

"global parasites", as many Japanese called them, had

been killed in Tokyo and Osaka.

But the "fascist Matsumoto" was responsible for all this, in

the eyes of the international media. Therefore, they

unleashed a furious hate campaign against the rebellious

Asians. Soon after, it changed to an irate and hysterical

choir of slander and lies. A military intervention, however,

was "currently not planned", according to the words of the

World President. The newscasters tried to calm the viewers,

but the whole thing smelled like war.

„We will see!", thought Frank.

„Now in your KCN-Shop! Call 070023456 and get him!Sergeant Powers, your supersoldier! He fights them all,yeah!", resounded a pithy voice out of the television. A handwas waving with an action figure - Sergeant Powers.

156

..Terrorists, fascists, evil people! Sergeant Powers finishes

them all! Get your Sergeant now and annihilate the evil

forces! Only 19.95 Globes, here in your KCN-Shop or in

every toyshop, yeah!", it came out of the tube.

Then the voice kindly told the kids, that they could borrow

some money at the "KCN Bank for Children", if their parents

would not have the Globes for Sergeant Powers. But only

for children, who were already six years old.

„Oh, shit!", sighed Alf. ..Turn it off!"

„ln a few minutes, I want to watch "The Little Whisperer" on

KCN. I always wanted to have a look at this brainwash

show for children."

..Please not...", answered Baumer disgustedly.

Shortly afterwards, KCN (Kid Control Network), the biggest

telestation for children worldwide, started its famous show,

called "The Little Whisperer".

Some years ago, KCN had started the series. Meanwhile, it

had mutated to a blockbuster, which was also watched by

the adult population and had extremely high viewing figures.

Nevertheless, the actual target audience of the telecast was

the younger generation. Since some time, the absurd show

could be watched in innumerable languages and on all

continents.

Frank and thereafter also Alf, who could not successfully

hide himself from the acoustic irradiation of the television,

stared eagerly, and at the same time distastefully, at the

screen: Now it was time for „The Little Whisperer"!

A slimy presenter with flashing white teeth and an also

flashing white suit, opened the show and the audience of

little children cheered loudly.

„Hey, kids! Tm Funny Paul! Who of are you?", he called

ecstatically.

"We are the kids!", roared the children and raved with great

enthusiasm.

157

Every show of "The Little Whisperer" started in that manner.This was the German version, which could also be receivedhere in Paris, together with approximately 700 other TVshows from all over the world. The camera swivelled aroundand showed alternating children of different nationalities.The „One-World" - on television it was cute at first sight.Then, all candidates of today's show were presented: Thelittle Tina from Bitterfeld, Tommy from Hamburg, Robin fromBremen, Gulay from Bochum, Kim Song from somewhereelse...

Anyhow, the children screamed full of joy and Alf moaned:„Turn it off! Please!"

But Frank remained hard. At least, he just wanted to watchone show of the series, the two policemen had talked about,when they had transported him to "Big Eye" at that time.After a while, the presenter called for the little Tina, a sweetblondie with braids and a cunning smile."You know, Tina, officer Bark and I must always payattention that people say no bad things about our WorldPresident. Therefore, we also need the many children hereto help us. You have told us last week, that your papa hassaid something very bad about our uncle World President.And you want to win your pony today, right?", said thepresenter and grinned .

"Yes, please, Funny Paul!", begged the little Tina and castup her nice blue eyes.

„lf you have caught your daddy, making a very badstatement, then officer Bark and I are more than proud ofyou, because you have really helped us", whispered FunnyPaul and turned to the audience. „Now, Tina will tell allthese very bad words to our friend! And who is our friend?"„The big Eeeeaaarrr!", screamed the children and stampedtheir applause.

158

A big ear of plastic was brought on the stage and the small

Tina uncertainly looked at it.

„Okay, Tina! The big ear is your friend, you can tell

everything!", said the presenter to the little girl.

J...I will do...", said Tina and smiled bashfully. J will tell

everything!".

Then she whispered to the big plastic ear: „Daddy has said,

the uncle World President is...ehmm...a swine and the

World President...ehmmm...should be shot!"

She still told this and that, and apparently she had even

written a lot of things on a small slip. The moderator

encouraged her, to tell everything at all. It would remain

their secret, and except for the audience and millions of

other viewers, nobody else would ever hear it. Everything

the little Tina said, was shown at the bottom of the screen.

„Oh!", shouted Funny Paul. „Your daddy really said all this?"

„Hmmm..., answered the child.

„Then your dad is not healthy. He is ill. I believe, we have to

help him, but we will ask him first. Now, we will ask Tina's

daddy!", called Funny Paul and waved his hands.

„Jaaaaaaa!", cheered the audience. Suddenly the cameras

switched live to a room, in which Mr. Notmeier, Tina's

father, sat behind a table.

He apparently was not very happy and smiled fearfully at

the telecameras. Then Funny Paul interviewed him to the

remarks, his daughter wanted to have heard and her father

tried to make some excuses. But he behaved more than

bumbling and finally started to stammer.

Shortly afterwards, some other candidates had a turn:

Tommy, Kim Song and a few more. They told the big plastic

ear all the "bad words" and politically incorrect remarks they

had heard from their parents, neighbors or relatives. Then

came the final.

159

„Who has been the best „Bad-Word-Detective" of today's

show?", shouted Funny Paul through the hall.

The children were allowed to vote and made Tina to the

best „Bad-Word-Detective" of this day.

„Tina! Tina! Tina! Tina!", it resounded out of the tube. The

little girl finally won a pony and fell down on her knees,

bursting with joy. Her was casually told by Funny Paul, that

her dad had to go to a "hotel" for a long time. The doctors

would do everything to help him, assured the presenter.

But the joy about her new pony was much too big, and Tina

probably heard this sentence only with half an ear. Then a

man in a dog costume and a police uniform came down

some stairs, went on the stage and welcomed his cheering

audience.

It was officer Bark, who was hunting „bad words" all day

long, in order to make the world a better place, as Funny

Paul mentioned. He brandished his police club, his

oversized hands of foam and his big handcuffs. The children

yelled.

At the end of the show, he sang the "One-World-Song" with

them. Funny Paul smiled at the telecameras and in the

background, the little Tina was leaping for joy about her new

pony like a bouncy ball. It all ended with some commercials

for kids. Frank and Alf were disturbed.

In the night from 26. on 27. February, Frank and Alfredalternately kept guard at the window of their hotel room andchecked the equipment. At three o'clock in the morning,they were finally ready to go. The rebels strapped theirbackpacks on, left the hotel room and sneaked over thedark corridor to the lower floor like two shadows. Theyparked the hire car some blocks away in a small side lanebehind an old tenement. Both men would never return to thehotel after the bombing, and planned to drive from Paris to

160

Compiegne as fast as possible. Their steps on the asphaltwere quiet, while the "Sunflower" slowly became a dark andsmall spot behind them. This night was unusually cold, butfortunately it was not raining. Now they moved with stillmore caution than in the night, when they had explored thecanalization. This time, even little mistakes could endangereverything.

If a police patrol had asked them about the content of theirbackpacks, the two rebels would have had more than just aproblem. Apart from that, they had guns and knifes in theirpockets. And even the stupidest cop would not believethem, that the were nothing but harmless tourists on asightseeing tour.

Again they crept from one dark corner to the next, crossinga lot of empty streets. Their faces were partly hidden behindbroad baseball caps, under which four wary eyes examinedthe vicinity, everywhere suspecting enemies or curiousobservers. They were like two predators, always ready tocatch their booty.

Some cars drove past them. At the end to the "Rue deYork", when they lurked in the shadow of an empty shop,they suddenly saw a police car, bending around the corner.Frank and Alf were shocked, nevertheless, they tried tosaunter inconspicuously about and acted, as if they did notheed the police car.

The sound of an humming engine became louder and thetension rose to the extreme. If just a single policeman wouldhave asked them for their particulars or wanted to look intotheir backpacks, then Frank and Alf would have had noother chance than killing him. And in case of emergency,also every other witness in sight.

No one had guns and NDC-23 by the kilo, who just wantedto visit Paris. The police car approached and seemed todrive more slowly now, but it didn't stop and no cop stepped

161

out. Probably, the driver only wanted to take a brief look at

these two strange guys. But this city was full of people like

this. It was luck for the two bombers, but probably also luck

for the policeman, because they had not hesitated to use

their weapons, if necessary.

„Lucky you!", whispered Frank quietly.

„Come on!", said Alf. „We are just good citizens."

„With some NDC-23 in our backpacks...", Kohlhaas giggled

and seemed to be relieved. Except for some tramps, the

streets of Paris were empty in this part of the city. After a

further short walk through the dark lanes, they had finally

reached the gully cover in front of the abandoned factory,

which Alfred had duly closed again, after they had returned

from the canalization. They entered the underworld again.

But this time it was no more disgusting but otherwise

harmless scouting expedition. This time, it was deadly

serious.

At the very thought of staying in this stinky vault untilnoontime of 01.03.2029, and even to sleep down here, thetwo men shuddered.

What would be, if they suddenly stood in front of some newgrids, which had been repaired in the last days? Or even infront of some policemen? No, there was no more room forsurprises. They had to keep their eyes open to react onchanges. Now it was the same way again, and rats andspiders appeared as a greeting committee in the darktunnels once more. When they had reached the first largerroom, they examined their equipment, in order to beprepared for all possible incidents.

Frank absently looked at his knife with the serrated blade,which John Throphy had organized for him on one of histrips to Belarus. Then he put it back into the pocket. The redcrosses which Alf had sprayed on some walls, were still

162

there and the two men were glad about this. Also thedestroyed grids had fortunately not been repaired, after theirfirst walk through the canalization. Frank and Alf decidednot to stay in the direct proximity of the event overnight. Ifpolicemen would scan the passages before thecelebrations, then within this range. They finally chose theclosed metro tunnel, that they could reach through the dughole in the wall. The air was much better here and fromsomewhere seemed to come a refreshing breeze.Nevertheless, it was cold, scary and dark there.„What will be if people walk around here again?",whispered Frank.

„One of us must stay awake and keep guard, while the otherone sleeps", answered Alf. „l will begin if you want!"They searched the pit for some fire wood and found allkinds of flammable waste after a few minutes. Probably itwere the inheritances of some tramps. Shortly afterwards,they kindled a small campfire, a tiny place of warmth andlight in that endless, yawning pit. Kohlhaas accepted Alf soffer, tucked himself up and slept on the uncomfortableground beside the rails, after he had put a few dry boardsand an old plastic foil there. However, this night was terrible,all alone in the darkness of this old tunnel. Frank started tofreeze.

Two hours later, his friend woke him up and asked him totake over the next night watch. Tired and nervous, Frankstraightened up and sat down at the glowing fire. It lastedonly some minutes, then Alf was sleeping and began tosnore.

That was the only sound in this eerie vault and Kohlhaaswas happy to hear it after a while. The darkness stared athim from a distance and sometimes he believed to hear asilent coughing or weeping somewhere, but in this night, themetro tunnel was empty.

163

It was at 6.00 o'clock in the morning. Frank and Alfred hada pitiful breakfast and started with their reconnaissance.They slunk quietly and slowly forward and still did not seeanybody at this early time. No grids or barricades had beenrepaired by any workers or had been placed by the police.At least, not on the first day in that hole. On 27.02.2029, thetwo men played card games or spent their time with variousconversations at the campfire in the closed metro tunnel.Later they explored some new passages and finallyreturned to their hiding place. They preferred the old metrotunnel to the canalization. Not only because of the better airand the campfire. Apart from the bigger halls with the waterreservoirs, the narrow canals were no places, where theywanted to stay longer than necessary. The hours seemed tobe endless, down below in the underground of Paris. Again,a long and uncomfortable night was waiting for them andFrank decided to be on guard at first, while Alfred tried tosleep.

Kohlhaas was also very tired and nibbled boredly on somechips from the supermarket. Meanwhile, the darknessaround him made the young man more nervous than everbefore, and so he decided to look for some more wood forthe campfire. Soon he had discovered another pile ofbroads near the tracks. After a while he cowered at thecampfire again - but suddenly he startled up.Something had shown its head in a dark corner beyond thepile of firewood. It had been a ghostly, pale child, pressingits finger to the lips, as if it wanted to remind Frank to besilent.

„Pssst!", he thought to have heard. Then the darknessreturned again.

He felt the adrenaline burning in his veins. Kohlhaas hastilyfetched his flashlight to examine the place of the spookyappearance, but there were only stones and garbage.

164

Nothing was to be seen of a child. He thought about wakingup his friend to tell him about the ghost, but he did not do it.There was nothing. Nothing at all.

After two hours, Frank was damn glad about the fact, thathe could hand over the night watch to Alfred now. Then heimmediately fell asleep. When it was his turn again, in theearly morning, he initially illuminated the strange place withhis flashlight. But there were no ghosts at all, only garbage.Franks nerves were raw and he started to search morethoroughly. But it must have been an illusion. Shortlyafterwards, the young man left the spooky place and hopedthat the panic would die down again.The fire flickered and fought against its extinction for awhile. Finally Kohlhaas had to return to the eerie corner tobring some more firewood. He was still scared and lookedaround, waiting for the coming of the ghostly child. But it didnot come and left Frank alone in the cold darkness.

On the next day, at half past eight, Alfred heard voices.

„Calm!", he hissed and touched Frank lightly. „Hey! Don't

you hear that?"

Kohlhaas startled and sharpened his ears. Baumer was

right. Now he heard the voices too. Someone was shouting

in the distance, and the calls resounded in the tunnels. They

had to be vigilant now.

J take a look!", said Alfred quietly.

„Damn! Be careful!", answered Frank and slapped on

Baumefs shoulder.

Alf jumped up and crawled through the hole in the wall into

the sewer corridor. He ran to a bifurcation and went into the

next passage. In his corner of his eye, he could see one of

the red crosses, he had sprayed on the wall before. The

voices became louder. They probably came from the larger

hall with the control room. After some minutes, Alf had

165

advanced far enough into the tangle of sewers corridors andhad reached the room with the water basins. Again, heheard someone call in French. He turned off his flashlightand disappeared in the darkness. Then he sneaked towardsto the source of noise. Someone had put on the lights in thehall and the old, high vault was weakly illuminated now.Baumer dared not to go further and huddled in a corner ofthe corridor, which led to the hall. The voices still became alittle louder and came out of the small room beside the hall,which could be reached over the stairs.Finally a man came out of the chamber and called hiscolleague. These men were workers of the public utilities ofParis, and made their daily inspection round here. Alf hopedthat they would not come too often.

After he had observed them for a while, and one theworkers had examined a water basin, the two men walkedaway and disappeared into a sewer corridor.Alf heard them talk loudly. Then their voices faded away inthe distance. The rebel turned around and sneaked againtowards the closed metro tunnel.

„l just hope, they haven't noticed that we have openedthose grids and that steel door", he said quietly to himself.But the workers had made a calm impression. This wasobviously just an usual inspection round, that they maderepeatedly, and with not much eagerness. And even if theywould repair something, Frank and Alfred could still destroyit in the next night again. Kohlhaas was waiting at the smallcampfire and was relieved, when he saw Alfred creepingthrough the hole in the wall.

„Damn! Where have you been? Thank God, it was yourflashlight. All right! I have already pulled my gun!", saidKohlhaas.

166

„lt were just some workers", explained Alf and sat down

beside his friend. ..Let's see, who will come down here

tomorrow!"

„Do you know, that they have found a full-grown alligator in

the canalization of Paris some years ago?", interrupted him

Frank and smiled grimly, looking at his comrade.

„l still prefer alligators to cops, Franky!", answered Alf.

This time, the night, that could only be differentiated from

the day by a look at the clock, was almost relaxing for the

two rebels. It was a bit like in the good old schooldays,

before a classwork, after a long time of learning. They knew

that the big showdown was inevitable now.

Tomorrow was the day of their final paper. Maybe a little

more bloody and dangerous as a class test. Frank and

Alfred kept guard once more and no ghosts or shades

appeared.

At 6.30 o'clock, Alfred's DC-stick beeped and woke the two

men. The campfire was still glowing, otherwise the cold

darkness had crept into each corner of the metro shaft

again.

They slowly got up and ate a few toasts for breakfast. The

slices of bread tasted like nothing, this cheap and lousy

grub from ..Globe Food". But it could still be used as a

possible last meal.

„We must go to our target area now. If some cops come

down here today, then in the morning hours. We must keep

everything in sight", explained Baumer and examined the

equipment on completeness.

He checked the time fuse of the bomb several times. Then

he hid the explosive under a pile of debris to avoid that any

derelicts find it. Meanwhile, Frank Kohlhaas looked at his

DC-stick. He wanted to make no mistakes, although they

had already gone the way twice. Like canal rats, which had

meanwhile become accustomed to their wet and dark home,

167

they silently crept through the sewer corridors and wereparticularly careful in the bigger halls, which hardly offeredany cover.

They groped in the dark of the tunnels, mostly with just oneflashlight in use, in order to cause no all too big light cones.Shortly afterwards, they came to the larger vault with thewater pumps, that reminded Frank of „Moria" from the oldfilm. Now they saw that the steel door was still open.Kohlhaas beheld the lamp. It looked like the blinde eye of aCyclops, staring at him. Nobody seemed to have been hereor nobody had recognized the destruction of the door. Bothmen breathed again.

After a walk through several sewer corridors, they hadalready come close to their goal. Now they squatted in adark corner and waited. The "Temple of Tolerance" and themetro station „Charles de Gaulle" were near. They heard ametro rumbling in the distance. Cars could not be heardtoday, because the "Avenue of Humanity" had already beenclosed off since a few hours. Suddenly human voices camenearer and the two men looked at each other. What wasthat?

At this very second, a cone of light shot directly above their

heads. Frank's and Alfred's hearts dived. But the ray

fortunately found no target, except for rusty pipes and the

dark throat of a sewer corridor.

A policeman of the GP, the "Global Police", approached and

scoured the environment for something.

„There is nothing here!", he shouted at one of his

colleagues, obviously also no Frenchman. The other man

answered in a strange sounding jargon.

„Okay!", it resounded out of another sewer tunnel in the

proximity of the "Temple of Tolerance".

„This job is fucked up!", said the cop near Frank.

168

Obviously he had no greater desire to crawl through dark

and stinky sewers.

„Check the tunnels in your area!", shouted the second GP

officer in the distance.

The policeman pointed his cone of light at the opposite

tunnel. Meanwhile, the two men were scared to death and

crouched in the brackish water, that flowed beneath them.

The policeman was only about fifty meters away from them

and mumbled something into his radio.

..Let's disappear from this hole!", hissed Frank quietly.

„But carefully...", whispered Alf and tried to turn around

noiselessly, while the cop babbled with the other one.

Frank and Alfred prepared for a quiet retreat to another

sewer corridor. They carefully crept away, but Frank

suddenly slid on the wet ground and slipped into the dirty

trickle. A quiet „Plop!" resounded out of the sewer, which

still increased the noise.

Now the two men were gripped by fear and tried to escape

from the danger zone as fast as possible. The head of the

policeman turned around and his flashlight with him. A light

cone immediately jumped towards the tunnel like a furious

lion, but there was nobody anymore.

Frank and Alf were already on the run to the next reservoir

room and the cop only heard quiet steps and the lapping of

water. A ray of light bored itself into the dark tunnel and

illuminated its forepart.

„ls there somebody?", shouted the policeman into the black

hole. „Hey, give me a sign!", he added.

Then he went back to another place. His radio croaked and

he tried to give an answer in English.

"I thought, I have heard something. But I think it was only a

rat!", he said.

169

In the meantime, Kohlhaas and Baumer had reached

another sewer corridor and the cop made no move to follow

them through the ugly passage.

"Don't know! Shit!", Frank heard him curse quietly.

He finally walked to another area of the sewer system. Both

assassins breathed again. Totally unprepared, they had

been surprised by that man. This cop had almost seen

them. Both still waited for another hour in the protection of

the smelly darkness, until no more voices could be heard in

the distance. On the way back to the closed metro tunnel

they did not encounter any other policemen. Nevertheless,

their nerves were still raw.

These GP's, who had been recruited in many different

countries, just like the GCF occupation troops, obviously

had no bigger references to the French culture. However,

their interest to explore the famous historic sewer system of

Paris was limited.

They just did their job and examined the direct area below

the square in front of the "Temple of Tolerance", that was

all. Policemen, who solely made "their job", just arrived at

the right moment in the eyes of Frank and Alfred.

When they came back to the metro tunnel, everything was

still at its place. Also the NDC-23 - which should have its

great performance in about two to three hours.

170

Bomb-happy...

While Frank and Alf were waiting for the attack in theirhiding place, and the minutes passed in a state ofnervousness and tension, Paris resembled an anthill at thesurface. The opening speech of Leon-Jack Wechsler,governor of the administrative sector ..Central Europe",should start at 13.00 o'clock. The streets of the metropoliswere already now, around 11,00 o'clock, perfectlyovercrowded.

Huge masses of people, roughly about two millions,clustered towards the "Avenue of Humanity" and it came tothe first clashes between the visitors of the event and thepolice in the early morning hours.

In the gray of dawn, bloody riots had broken out withnumerous casualties and many deads. In many parts of themetropolis the violence still ruled the streets, particularly inthe Arabic ghettos.

Over 40 GP-Policemen and hundreds of Arabs had alreadybeen killed. Last night, French patriots had fixed someenormous transparencies with slogans like ..France is thecountry of the Frenchmen!" or ..Freedom for France! Downwith the World Government!" at several big buildings in theinner city.

Some activists had been caught by the police, three youngFrenchmen had even been shot. In the north of Paris, youngArabs had tried to penetrate into some suburbs, which wereinhabited by Frenchmen. Here they had burned cars or hadbroken into houses. Finally they had encountered somearmed Frenchmen and the police. Over 200 people hadbeen killed in that street fight. An illegal demonstration ofthe "Islamic Federation" in the opposite part of the former

171

capital of France against the policy of the World

Government in the Middle East, had likewise ended with

violent outbursts. Over thirty thousand Muslims had come

together to protest and could only be dispersed by the

security forces, after they had attacked the crowd with

tanks.

Hugo and Baptiste, the Frenchmen, who had visited the

meeting in Ivas at that time, were already active in the

boiling metropolis since weeks.

Their political group had distributed tens of thousands of

illegal leaflets in the whole city, in which they called up the

population to resist the foreign rulers and to fight against the

World Government. Some activists who had been caught by

the police, were never seen again.

Furthermore, they let countless little pieces of paper with

rebellious calls rain down on the shopping streets, from the

roofs of some multistory buildings.

They had uploaded a lot of forbidden webpages on the

Internet and had even established a secret radio channel

which daily sent informations. Apart from this, the freedom

fighters had sprayed some oppositional slogans on the

entrance door of the "Temple of Tolerance". The police and

the GSA were still investigating feverishly. When the police

had located the secret radio station in the end, most of the

French acivists had made it to esape them.

This form of resistance was also not less dangerous than a

bombing because prison or even death was waiting for

people who were classified by the GSA as "incurable

politically incorrect".

Therefore, not only Frank and Alfred risked their lifes down

in the tunnel system below the city, in the battle against the

global dictatorship. Even at the surface, many Frenchmen,

above all the young people, stretched their heads that far

out of the swamp of anxiety and anonymity that the police

172

could cut them off. This so called "festival" would becomebloody. Even without a bomb strike. After the openingspeech, the people would only see on video, the militaryparades of the GCF troops would begin. Moreover, massesof journalists infested the city like a swarm of grasshoppersand were eager to spread the ideology of the New WorldOrder. A happy world full of peace and harmony, wearing along cloak - made of lies.

As the „One-World-Song" resounded out of theloudspeakers that had been situated everywhere along the"Avenue of Humanity", only a small part of the giant crowdsang along. This was disappoiting for the GSA agents whometiculously filmed the people.

Sometimes, even bottles and stones were thrown in thedirection of the loudspeakers and screens which showed nopictures yet. Here, the GP officials took drastic measuresand pulled every molester out of the crowd. Who wascaught disappeared in a police vehicle.So many of the two million spectators were already upset,although the festival had not been opened by Wechsler sofar. Apart from that, many Parisians also just holed up intheir houses, hoping that this day would pass as quickly aspossible. In spite of the publicity campaign of the mediawhich stylized the "Festival of the New World" to a newclimax of human development.

The population of the sector ..Central Europe" had beenforced to pay still higher tributes and taxes in the lastmonths and the social misery was growing more and more.Therefore, the people had not very much of this ..Festival ofthe New World", and all the propaganda around it. Theracial tensions also continued to extend. If one drovethrough some parts of Paris, it seemed that France wasclose to civil war. But all this was a part of the policy of thenew rulers, a small piece of their worldwide opus of decay.

173

The screaming crowd above their heads could easily be

heard, down in the canalization. It roared and yelled and

sang and stamped. Frank and Alfred seemed to become

only more nervous, because of this din. Time was running

out fast, and soon the critical moment would come. The

governor was on his way to the inner city of Paris. Now it

was vital to pay attention. All or nothing!

„Whafs the time, Baumer?", asked Frank with an uncertain

flickering in his eyes, while the „One-World-Song" was sung

above him.

„Three minutes past twelve. Still about an hour...", answered

Alf and extinguished the campfire.

„Okay, let's go!", said Kohlhaas, nervously fumbling on his

cap.

They checked their equipment again and Frank stroked the

explosive in the blue bags.

„For you father, for you sister!", he silently murmured and

stared into the dark tunnel.

Both took their heavy luggage and loaded their weapons.

Then they went to the hole to enter the canalization. Each

step was arduous now and was accompanied by a wildly

pounding heart. The palms of the two men filled with tiny

rills of sweat, while the ubiquitous darkness stared at them

still more malicious than ever before.

Their flashlights shone the way and they moved through the

sewer corridors like creeping cats on the hunt. The larger

halls were empty now.

All attention, probably even those of the workers of the

public utilities, was given to the enormous spectacle at the

surface. What Frank and Alfred did not know was that all

employees of the city of Paris were allowed to stay away

from work if they visited the ceremonies. Both rebels walked

forward through the tunnels on quiet soles. They had soon

reached the passage, where that GP policeman had nearly

174

found them. Their hearts pounded like crazy steam

hammers and Frank believed to be able to hear the echo of

his pulse in the tunnel.

"At 13.00 o'clock, Wechsler will start his speech. When it

begins, I put the time fuse of the bomb on ten minutes. This

should be enough, to get our asses out of the danger

zone!", explained Alf.

"Okay!", said Frank who could hardly bear the tension.

Baumer carefully prepared the bomb and Frank just

watched him.

Meanwhile, the black limousine of the governor had stopped

in front of the "Temple of Tolerance" and a finely clothed

chauffeur opened the door. A swarm of policemen

immediately sourrounded the big, flashy vehicle. Shortly

afterwards, a black varnish shoe appeared beneath the car

door. Then the elegant rest followed. Leon-Jack Wechsler

had arrived.

Yesterday he had still been in London and had delivered a

speech in front of the members of the Grand Lodge, what

belonged to his tasks as its second Grand Master.

Now he was in Paris, in order to open the "Festival of the

New World" solemnly. London, the best supervised city on

the planet, except for New York and Washington, was

Wechslefs adoptive home. Here, his ancestors had already

made lucrative bank businesses. Then a part of his family

had emigrated to Chicago and in the end he had come back

to the former capital of England.

The governor smiled and shook the hands of some

subordinated dignitaries. These bowed to the dark-haired

man with the noticeable round glasses. The politician was

fortyish and had already made a great career. Originally

coming from the bank business, he had also been active in

numerous media concerns and energy companies.

Wechsler was a powerful man and loyal to his education, he

175

despised values like honesty or scruple. If it was necessary,also lie and deceitfulness did it, because only the aim wasimportant and its name was "might".

The polititian combed his hair once again and lookedaround with cunning eyes. The crowd was far away fromhim and he had no reference to those people and he alsodid not want that. He did, what had to be done, and said,what had to be said, so that the new order could live. Theplan to create this new world, had been prepared longbeforehand, and it tolerated no deviations or delays.Leon-Jack Wechsler was a cogwheel in this cruel machine,but he was an important cogwheel. The politician knew that,and everyone who knew him, knew that too. And hisservants did well not to annoy him.

The clock was ticking and would never stop. As the greatwheel of history always revolved - overrunning those whowere not able to follow the time.

It was 12.58 o'clock on this historical day, which celebratedthe New World Order. Governor Leon-Jack Wechslergrinned like a Pharisee and slowly walked up the stairs tothe speaker's desk. Numerous security men encircled thestage. Most of them just looked disinterestedly around.They seemed to suspect nothing evil.All these security men were just too many and were to wellarmed that someone seriously would have ventured toattack them. Tanks, regiments of GP policemen, GCFsoldiers and still more best equipped Riot Control Squadshad been congregated here, to force the people to love thisnew world. Moreover, the dreaded Skydragons were lurkingin the sky, and they were always able to smash the masseslike a hammer. It was suicide to challenge this power.Leon-Jack Wechsler stroked his black business suit again,looking at the spectators in the distance. Many of themprobably hated him deep inside, but this was rather amusing

176

than dangerous, from his point of view. The "herd ofanimals", as he and his Fellows called the rest of mankind,would remain impotent and enslaved forever.

"I welcome you! People of our One-World!

I am so endlessly happy, to be allowed, to welcome youhere today. So many people have come to our beautifulParis. We have invited you to this "Festival of the NewWorld", to a great celebration of humanitarianism! And all ofyou have come, full of joy and expectation!"

The crowd made some noise and Wechsler looked at theherd with a cynical smile...

177

Red Moon

The voice of the governor echoed in the depths of thecanalization. Frank and Alf jumped out of their hiding placein the shadows like predators, placing the bomb at thepreviously selected position. Above them, they heard themurmur of the crowd which listened to Wechslefs speech.Alf adjusted the time fuse and when a faint "beep" sounded,it was like the starting shot to a sprint for the two rebels."The band begins to play!", said Alf and nodded at Frank.The clock of death had been put on and was ticking itsvicious song until the bloody finale. Frank Kohlhaas andAlfred Baumer ran like fleeing rabbits into the tunnel fromwhich they had come. In ten minutes, the NDC-23, thisdeadly explosive, would tear a huge hole into the ground infront of the "Temple of Tolerance".

The way back appeared hostile and doubts grew in thebrains of the two men. Would their plan really besuccessful?

They scurried through the fetid sewer corridors and therooms with the reservoirs, with the cones of light in front ofthem. Meanwhile, the dark path through the underworld hadburned itself into their minds and both men rushed forward,as if they were hounded by a demon. Above them, fate tookits course and the Red Moon, the bloody moon, lookeddown at the "Avenue of Humanity" with a grim face...

"Humaneness! What is the sense of this magnificent word?",called Wechsler into the microphone. "It meansbenevolence! The uppermost principle of our new world.Equality, freedom and benevolence for everyone! We havebrought it to the people. A better world under the sign of

178

peace. And this is the reason, why we may celebrate today.

It has been successful - the attempt, to make this world a

better place. When I became governor of the sector "Central

Europe", there was always only one slogan for me: We can

do it!

Of course, it was not always easy to give the people these

holy ideals, but today we are united and happy. We love

each other and we are free!

And whom do we have to owe that? Our faith in the power

of huma...

BOOM!!!

A loud blast cut off Wechslefs next word and tore the lies

out of his throat. It was like the ground had opened to drag

the devil himself down to hell. The explosion was

devastating and ripped a large hole into the square in front

of the "Temple of Tolerance".

The forefront of the building was torn up by the shock wave

like a piece of paper. Several dozens of security men and

politicians were torn to pieces, among them also Leon-Jack

Wechsler. Asphalt pieces, concrete, splinters of wood and

body parts rained down.

Where the governor had spoken a few seconds ago, a

smoking abyss had been torn into the ground. Mangled

corpses and wreckage covered the place.

Frank and Alf ran still faster. The deafening blast of the

explosion had shaken the tunnel system of Paris to the last

corner. For both men, it was the second starting shot and

they were close to loose their nerves.

"Victory! I can't believe it! We have really done it!", gasped

Frank and sped forward. He had almost slipped to the

ground, but Alf could still hold him. "Run!"

179

The people were quiet for a short moment, when they

perceived the end of the governor on the video screens.

Policemen and soldiers were shocked and looked around,

full of horror and confusion.

A swarm of journalists and cameramen, that had stood in

front of the stage had also been shredded by the explosion.

Some had immediately been dead, others had been hurled

away several meters and were lying on the ground, with torn

limbs, screaming and bleeding.

Their colleagues who were filming the event from the

distance, suddenly pointed their cameras at the bloody

scenario. The terror had come over the square in front of

the "Temple of the Tolerance", paralyzing the gawking

crowd for a while.

Nevertheless, the brains of the people slowly processed the

new situation and, above all, the security forces tried to

react quickly on the unexpected bomb strike. Radiograms

reached the policemen and soldiers, hastily and nervously

yelled commands and orders. Some officers were sent to

the canalization to look what had happened.

Shortly afterwards, a dozen men climbed into the hole.

Others were called to the nearby gully covers. The fact that

so many manhole covers around the square had been weld

shut by the policemen, made them problems now. They all

had to be levered up, what caused a long delay.

After a while, some of the officers entered the tangle of

sewer corridors and tried to find suspicious persons. Their

calls and the sound of their heavy boots echoed through the

tunnels.

The two bombers were already far away now and passedthe dug hole, which led to the abandoned metro tunnel.Despite the red signs on the walls, they selected the wrongcorridor and lost a few minutes of precious time. Dozens of

180

police officers already followed them, but they were still faraway. The panicky rebels cursed and became even morenervous now.

"I...I just pushed over the edge! Sorry, Alf! That was thewrong way!", said Frank, gasping for breath and sweating."Yes, all right. I had sprayed these crosses on the walls,exactly for that fucking reason, man!", hissed Alf and wavedhis friend nearer.

They found one of Alf s marks and Kohlhaas opened thedigital map on his DS-Stick with nervous fingers: "The firststorage room we had found is not far!"They crept forward to the exit, while the inner tension slowlybecame unbearable. But this they were on the right way.Nevertheless, they still had to traverse a lot of long and darksewer corridors. They cautiously crept in the direction of thestorage room with the basin - it had to be at the end of thispassage. Both men just used one single flashlight now, tocause not too much light. Frank did not dare to think, whatwould happen if suddenly some policemen would stand infront of them.

The two rebels silently scurried forward. Now they could seea strange blaze at the end of the dirty sewer corridor. Theypaused and tried to recognize something. Frank caught hisbreath.

Someone had turned on one of the old lamps in the roomwith the basins. The usual darkness which had alwaysprotected them had vanished now. With careful movements,they stalked through the tunnel. Frank crept to the end ofthe sewer corridor and cowered there. Then he peeredaround the corner. There was nobody. The room seemed tobe empty. A moment after, the young rebel turned around toAlf and waved him nearer. "We have to pass this room!Then we can hide again in the narrow tunnels", whisperedFrank and felt out his gun.

181

"But who has turned on that light?", hissed Alf nervously.

"Damn! You ask the wrong person! Come on now!", said

Kohlhaas.

They crawled forward and entered the daunting room.

Behind the pool edge of the water basin, they crept into the

dimness. Suddenly the heard voices and the patter of steps

with heavy boots. Frank coughed into his breathing mask

which was meanwhile wet and dirty. His heart seemed to

explode. Alf stared at him with an appalled face and

swallowed quietly.

"Come on! Here!", it resounded out of a sewer tunnel. The

light cones of two flashlights danced forth out of the dark

hole.

"Maybe here is someone!", they heard, while the steps

came nearer.

Frank tried to calm himself, in these seconds of highest

tension.

"If we shoot them, we will just make a lot of noise. That

would attract only more of them", he whispered and Alf

regarded him with fear in his eyes.

"We are fucked up, my friend!", said Baumer with an almost

whining undertone.

"Into the basin! Come on!", hissed Frank and climbed quietly

over the pool edge. Alfred followed him without saying a

word. Like two otters, they smoothed into the repulsive pond

that seemed to be deep enough to hide. Kohlhaas touched

his combat knife and Alf desperatly looked in his direction.

The steps were now in close proximity and both rebels took

a deep breath full of stench. Then they disappeared into the

brackish water.

Frank closed his eyes and tried to think about nothing. This

was really perverse, but it was better than to be dead.

Suddenly, a blaze touched the water surface, otherwise it

182

was just dark and Frank tried not to think about all the things

that could be in this ugly swill.

"Come on, check this reservoir room!", it resounded through

the brackish water. Now they recognized two policemen.

One of the officers walked around the basin and illuminated

the dark corners of the room, then he went to the next

sewer tunnel.

The time appeared endless and Frank slowy became

queasy, he was close to vomit into the stinky water. Alf felt

the same. Meanwhile, the policeman muttered some

unintelligible fragments of words into his radio. Frank

emerged for a second to breathe some air and heard the

officer say something.

"I must get out of this shit!", he thought to himself, but the

policeman was still waiting beside the basin. A moment

after, he walked through the room, around the basin, and

finally leaned against the pool edge.

The two rebels tried to communicate by gestures or looks,

but the water was so dirty and dark that this was impossible.

Now, Frank decided to act on his own.

The policeman was still standing at the opposite end of the

pool, leaning against the basin's edge and talking with his

colleague, who had obviously gone into another sewer

corridor. "Did you find something?"

"Only rat shit here!", it came back with a laughter.

Kohlhaas could not understand anything else. Only God

knew, where these two policemen came from. Anyhow, they

were no Frenchmen. The officer in front of Frank seemed to

be Hispanic or something like that.

Kohlhaas quietly moved below the surface and dived

through the dirty water to the edge of the basin like an eel.

As long as the officer was in this position, and the other one

was somewhere in a tunnel, he had to act. The young man

took his combat knife, pulled it out of the sheath and waited

183

for a few seconds, while the officer was mumbling

something into his radio. The rucksack on Frank's back

which had been freed of its deadly cargo bugged him now,

because it hampered his movements. Kohlhaas felt like a

crocodile that had waited for the gazelle all day long. And

the gazelle had come to the border of his realm to drink. He

pushed himself off the floor of the basin and jumped up to

the pool edge.

The sudden sound of splattering water behind him let the

policeman turn around with surprise. The officer tried to

release the safety catch of his machine gun, but Frank was

faster.

Kohlhaas rammed his knife deeply into the cop's neck and

jumped on the ground beside the water basin. His opponent

gasped for breath and stumbled back in confusion.

Frank grabbed the man and pressed his hand on the

officer's mouth, so that he could not make too much noise.

Meanwhile, Alf had also climbed out of the basin and held

his combat knife nervously in his hand.

"Unnnghh!" The injured policeman lurched and Frank

rammed his blade again into the neck of his enemy, while

he pulled the man to the ground. The cop still fidgeted and

tried to shake off his attacker. Suddenly Baumer came from

the front and knifed the officer too.

The policeman finally collapsed and gave up his resistance.

Both men pulled his heavy body some meters away and let

him lie in a corner. Then they heard the voice of the other

cop who called again something out of a sewer tunnel and

seemed to return. Frank and Alf rebels had to disappear

now, as fast as possible, before he would find his dead

colleague.

For their luck, the way out of this room had remained in their

minds, although they still were totally confused. They ran

into a dark tunnel and made off. Some minutes later they

184

heard a loud scream behind them. Probably the otherpoliceman had now realized that the room with the waterbasin had not been empty. The two men ran and ran andfinally reached the exit. As fast as they could, they left thecanalization behind them. Wet, smelly and blood-smeared,they crept to the surface. Frank and Alf hastily put on theirjackets to hide the conspicuous bloodstains on their clothes.The two bombers breathed again and enjoyed a freshbreeze of air. They just could not believe it! They had madethat bombing and the police did not catch them - so far.Now they only had to reach their car to escape from themetropolis, which slowly fell into chaos.

Shortly afterwards, the two assassins hastened through thestreets. They were hardly regarded, because around themParis became a huge boiler full of rage and confusion.Groups of people had gathered everywhere, men andwomen ran across the streets, cars honked and they heardthe voice of an excited newscaster out of the window of ahouse. The bombing had shocked the whole city - just asthey had planned it.

Frank and Alf fastly ran forward and nobody paid attentionto them. After a while they had reached the side street, inwhich they had parked their car. It had not been stolen orbroken up in the time of their absence - and this was notself-evident in these days.

They finally exchanged their filthy and dirty clothes withsome new dresses that had still been in the trunk. Frankthrew the dirty clothes into a garbage can, started theengine and drove away. It trip lasted, because many streetswere closed off or were clogged with people. It was nerve-racking, but finally they reached one of the streets which ledthem out of the boiling city.

185

Paris slowly disappeared behind them, Frank and Alfpausend for breath. Steffen de Vries had already landed inCompiegne at the arranged meeting place and wasnervously waiting for their arrival. While time passed, theBelgian felt more and more uncomfortable. But Kohlhaasand Baumer finally reached the small village nearCompiegne. Now they could return to Ivas. Before the take-off, they freed their hire car of its vehicle number andburned it in the forest, hidden from any curious views.The car was totally destroyed and no one would ever beable to identify the wreck. When they welcomed the Belgian,he was more than impressed with their success, and he wasalso more than relieved at the same time.Steffen de Vries shook their hands and was absolutelyamazed. The radio had already informed him about thesituation in Paris since the bombing. Perfectly exhausted,Frank and Alf climbed into the airplane. Shortly afterwards,they left "Central Europe".

In the former capital of France, the situation had meanwhilebecome dramatically acute. After the crowd had seen theend of the governor on the numerous video screens, astrange and confusing silence had ruled the "Avenue ofHumanity" for several minutes. Many people had not beenable to handle with the unforeseen event.The security forces admonished the crowd to remain quiet,while tanks threateningly rolled out of the side streetstowards the cooking human pulp. After a while, one heardthe first spectators approvingly yelling and clapping theirhands. The crowd was moved by a tumultuous unrest andmore and more people started to laugh and shout."Thank God! That pig is dead!", screamed a group of mensomewhere in the giant throng. In that moment, the

186

shouters ignored the fact that they were all filmed by GSA

agents.

"This would also be the right end for the World President!",

yelled another man at the top of his lungs.

Then still more people began to shout things like this. Some

young men stamped their feet and sang the forbidden

national anthem of old France. Many of the persons

standing around them joined the singing, although a lot of

people no longer knew the correct text, because the song

had been forbidden by the new rulers.

"Freedom for France! Down with the World Government!"

A choir came from the rear part of the crowd and the shouts

were carried by more and more people. Hundreds joined the

furious screaming and soon the "Avenue of Humanity"

quaked under the roar of countless Parisians. It was a

strange picture, this huge crowd, clogging the streets and

slowly getting out of control.

The faces of many people were lined with pain. Millions ofParisians lived a life full of sorrow, poverty and perpetualinsecurity. Therefore, it was no wonder that the displeasurehad grown inside them in the last years.Meanwhile, a big part of the population of Paris consisted ofbadly paid workers and peons. The salaries were usuallythat small that one just did not starve and was able to paythe high rents for the shabby dwellings.Many of the people here knew the gnaw feeling of an emptystomach. The food prices and the fees for electricity,heating and water had steadily been raised since 2018.Hundreds of thousands of inhabitants of the city had alreadyfallen through the welfare net and had become streetpeople. Sometimes, they just froze to death in the winters.This was the sad truth about the "new world". There wasalso no longer a social welfare system, because the World

187

Government had abolished it as a result of the high publicdebt. All this was a good hotbed for a revolt. But even now,many people did not dare to protest. They were stillintimidated and tried to hide somewhere among the others.They frightenedly looked at the surveillance cameras thatwere situated everywhere. Some of them even sneakedaway from the avenue and went to the side streets. So thecrowd broke up into a submissive and a rebellious part inthe following hours.

Nevertheless, it was astonishing, how many citizenssuddenly had the courage to raise their voices. Theanonymity of the crowd seemed to fill them with bravery.

"Freedom for France! Down with the World Government!""Freedom for France! Down with the World Government!""Freedom for France! Down with the World Government!"

The choir of desperate protest increased and becamegradually louder. Somewhere in the crowd, Frenchmen andimmigrants started to attack each other. The Moslemsscreamed their own slogans, refering to Islam, which werealso hostile against the World Goverment. In the middle ofthe mass began a riot. The angry people assaulted eachother with bottles, knifes and clubs. Even some shots couldbe heard.

Policemen and GCF soldiers, who had meanwhile encircledthe crowd, flanked by tanks, threatened by loudspeakers toimmediately stop the antigovernmental shouts. But crowdshave their own dynamics. So is the single man mostlycowardly and obsequious, but as a part of a mass hesometimes becomes a hero.

The orders of the officers were ignored, and after a shorttime, policemen, soldiers, GSA observers and the crowdopposed each other like two warring armies.

188

Now the GP-squadleaders yelled the order to "catchseditious people in the crowd" into their radios and groupsof officers with heavy body armor clubbed their way throughthe mob to get all those, who had been idenitfied by theGSA agents. Finally, the situation escalated more and more.The policemen were welcomed with bottles, cobblestones oreven bare fists, while they uncontrollably beat everyonedown who stood in their way. Nevertheless, the screamingof the mass became louder, despite their brutality.Yes, the more people were cut down by the clubs of thecops, the more people joined the chorus of protest at otherplaces in the giant sea of humans.

On 03.01.2029 at 18.00 o'clock, the first Molotov cocktailstowrads policemen and tanks in a side street of the "Avenueof Humanity". The GP's immediately returned fire andriddled the attackers with bullets.

In return, some Parisians armed themselves with clubs,knifes, axes and even guns. Now the violence expandedlike a plague, seizing thousands of people along the"Avenue of Humanity".

The warnings, the police officers were shouting, were notnoticed anymore by the raging crowd and the massanswered with the old French national anthem.The forbidden song became a surging wave of emotionsand shook the mass from one end to the other. The oldground of the boulevard trembled under the loud sound ofthe outlawed hymn. Something, the former capital of Francehad not seen since decades.

The tanks finally came closer and the GCF soldiers andpolicemen took positions. It lasted only a few minutes untilthe GCF commander gave the order to shoot the peopledown. The bloodbath started.

189

While the mass was singing the strictly forbidden old hymnin perfect harmony, and a surprising great number of peoplecould still remember the text, the first gunshots resoundedover the avenue."Tac! Tac! Tac! Tac!"

The noise of gunfire increased and hundreds of men andwomen broke down. Then a terrible hail of bullets sweptthrough the front ranks behind the barriers - all thepolicemen and soldiers began to fire now. The tanks movedforward and pointed their heavy machine guns at thenumerous targets.

"Tac! Tac! Tac! Tac!", it echoed over the avenue which wasallegedly dedicated to humanity. The salvos of assault riflescut hundreds of people down like a huge scythe. Finally thecrowd fell into panic. The old French national anthem lapsedinot silence and was exchanged with the terrified cries of thepeople.

The soldiers and policemen could hardly miss theircountless targets and they did their job, following the ordersof their commanders and were killing without mercy.Most of them were no Frenchmen, and if they were attackedby this crowd in this foreign land, they just had to put downthe uprising. And they did it. Hundreds of corpses coveredthe "Avenue of Humanity" after only a few minutes.The security forces marched forward in a closed firing lineand shot their way through the sea of men, women andchildren. In particular, the heavy full metal jacket bullets ofthe tank guns were devastating. Soon the screaming crowdfled in all directions. Fences were ripped down, cars wereoverturned and the Parisians trampled each other to death.Behind them, the soldiers and policeman marched overcountless dead bodies like a slowly moving wall of death.Then the security forces got a new command. The unruly,but unarmed crowd, had been driven back by them and

190

looked like the giant Persian army at the battle of

Gaugamela which had been defeated by the phalanx of

Alexander the Great. The policemen, soldiers and tanks

stopped.

"The Skydragons are coming! Stop!", shouted one of the

squad leaders into his radio and wiped off the sweat from

his brow. The killing work had been exhausting.

Orders were given and the dreaded helicopters, coming

from a nearby military base in the west of Paris, came from

the sky. Shortly afterwards, the pilots of the Skydragons

saw nothing but a swarm of frightened ants, fleeing through

the streets.

Finally, the helicopters reduced their altitude and made their

gatling machine guns and their grenade launchers ready to

fire.

"Okay! We just wait for your orders!", said the commander

of the Skydragon squadron to his higher officer.

"What are you waiting for? Fire!", screamed the superior.

The pilot of the helicopter hesitated for some seconds, as if

he would think about that, what he should do now. In the

end, he simply said to himself that this was his "job" which

had to be done.

He was from Uzbekistan, with Russian ancestors, and his

name was Alexander. Meanhwile, the young man was a

soldier of the GFC since three years, and this was the first

time he had got the order to kill unarmed civilians.

Alexander tried to ignore it.

"If I wouldn't do it, another man would...", he excused his

acting in front of himself.

Nevertheless, the payment for GCF soldiers was good -

and he had to feed a wife and three children. Apart from

that, every job had its dark sides. This was just the way of

the world. Now the automated target aquisition showed him

a great number of people. He stopped thinking and started

191

to fire. It became a massacre. The heavy bullets of theSkydragons smashed flesh and bones. Countless hit peoplecollapsed below the helicopters, screaming, crying, dying,tumbling on the asphalt. Skulls were shredded and bodieswere mangled by this murderous blaze of gunfire. Theslaughter almost lasted one hour.

There was no escape for those who were caught by theautomated target aquisiation. Where the Skydragons hadraged, a cruel picture remained. Innumerable bodies werecovering the blood-soaked streets of Paris.Alexander, the family father, recognized a man in the cornerof his eye. His head was torn, while he still tried to creepforward, pulling a bloody trace over the street. It washorrible. The Russian was shaken by doubts again, but hefinally suppressed them. It had to be done, it was an order,and his only choice was to kill. Then he kept on shooting atthe ants, down there on the ground.

While policemen, soldiers and tanks were called to otherparts of Paris, in order to eliminate insurgents, the day cameto an end.

But the riots still lasted for two further weeks. Manydiscontented Parisians attacked the local police stations intheir districts or assaulted local politicians. The headadministrator of Paris, Richard de la Croix, was shot in theopen street by an unknown man. Burning cars and houses,firing tanks and policemen, ruled the street picture in manyparts of the furious metropolis for days.But in the end the order was restored. This time, the LodgeBrothers who frequently used the lie as a their weapon, hadconsulted its brother: the terror. And he was successful.Even the bravest man was powerless against the unlimitedinconsiderateness of the security forces in the long term.About 40000 people died in the riots and street fights on01.03.2029, and in the following weeks. Moreover, several

192

hundred policemen and GCF soldiers were killed. Paris hadbeen drowned in blood. Now it was over...

With him

It was already late. Mr. Morris, 56 years old and one of thesecretaries of the World President, had to hurry. Thisappointment was extremely important. His taxi hadstruggled through the jammed streets, from the airport ofNew York to the inner city. However, time really pressednow. Mr. Morris scurried through the big entrance door of agigantic skyscraper and ran to the lift. The beheld his watchand became nervous. But in the end he reached the 33.floor of the building just in time...

"Come in, Mr. Morris!", called somebody out of a luxurious

office room on the uppermost floor of the skyscraper.

"Good afternoon, Mr. World President!", said the man with

the gray temples and the just as gray suit, smiling unsteadily

and submissively. His interlocutor stared out the window

down at the streets of the New York and did not turn

around.

"I have the newest internal messages from Paris...", said

Morris excitedly.

"Aha!", returned the World President.

"Yes, the situation has become acute, as the GSA men

have told me!", gasped the older gentleman, totally

exhausted.

"Really?", asked his boss.

"Yes, Mr. World President! Confidential studies...",

explained Morris, but he was interrupted.

"Where is your place in our great organization, Mr. Morris?",

interrogated the World President and still stared at the

hectic tangle of cars and people between the bulky bank

houses of New York's inner city.

194

"I beg your pardon, Sir!", replied the confused secretary, stillstanding beside the door.

"Which lodge, Mr. Morris?", clarified the president.„Eh! I'm a fellow of the "Sons of the Mountain", Sir! Thelodge is called "Sons of the Mountain"...San Francisco, Mr.World President!", stammered Morris baffledly."Grade?", muttered the man in front of the window."Eh, I'm in the 4th grade, Sir! That's all I have achieved untilnow, Sir!", stuttered the secretary."Well, perhaps that is enough for you, Mr. Morris!""I wanted to talk about Paris...", said the servant, but he wasinterrupted again.

"Sons of the Mountain"? One of my nephews is also there!",whispered the World President.

His secretary tried to direct the conversatrion on theincidents in Paris, but the World President just groaned andordered him to stop talking about these things."Listen, Mr. Morris! I know what has happened in Paris, andI give a shit on it!", he said quietly. "Not even a damn fart!Do you think that the "great revolution" will break looseagainst us now, Mr. Morris!"

The World President seemed to be almost amused. "Leon-Jack Wechsler is dead. I have already determined hissuccessor this morning. And now, I don't want to talk aboutthis unimportant and boring kids' stuff anymore!""But the terrorists have...", Morris tried to explain with anunsteady voice.

The World President seemed not to hear him. He still lookedimpassively out of the huge window of his luxury office:"Bring me a glass of orange juice, Mr. Morris, and place iton the desk!"

"Yes, Sir!", stammered his secretary and left the room. Aftera few minutes he returned and put a glass of orange juiceon the table.

195

"Thanks!", said the chairman of the international community,

but he did not turn around. "Do you think that we would be

there where we are, if things like that uninteresting fuss in

Paris had ever impressed us just one time?", he added

coldheartedly.

"Yes, I don't know...", Morris became more and more

uncertain.

"We are the rulers of this world for two reasons. First,

because we have servants like you, Mr. Morris. Second,

because the old and great plan to conquer this planet is

perfectly ripe and has no weaknesses or errors."

The secretary stared at the World President with an

astonished face.

"Mr. Morris, you are, as a member of the lodge of the "Sons

of the Mountain", in your place. I am in my place, as World

President. What has happened in Paris was good...", he

continued.

"What do you mean?", asked the secretary and was

puzzled.

"Well, now we can tell the masses, how dangerous terrorism

is and that they can only get protected by an increased

surveillance! The media will hammer it into their hollow

heads like a mantra, constantly preach and repeat it, so

often until that herd of animals has understood our

message!", said the president.

Then he remarked: "Mr. Morris, no one has ever managed it

to stop us. For decades, and centuries, our power has

grown, and it is still growing. We have struck deep roots,

like a cancer that can not be destroyed anymore, because it

has already spread to the last part of the body. We have

brought down kings and have smashed nations if they have

stood in our way. We have perfectly infiltrated this globe and

there is no escape for no one. In 2018, we put the mask

from our face and showed us to the people, but they

196

remained silent and let us eat them. The nations havebehaved like the rabbit in front of the snake. The old writingshave predicted it and so it has happened. The great planbecame reality. And now, we want to bring mankind theslavery that it deserves. Now our time has come, and wewill rule this planet forever!"

"But perhaps our reaction in Paris was not right?", saidMorris.

The World President, who made him stand as always andthis time even turned his back to him, harrumphed andanswered, "Not right? Of course it was right! The massesshall know that we control them. They can hate us but, first,they must fear us. Their world, the old world, is broken intopieces and will never return. The new world is our creation.Yes, we want to show our power openly, as the elders ofour past always intended it. They were forced to spin theirthreads secretly. We don't need secrecy any longer,because we are the rulers of this earth. In our hands is allthe might of the world, and the sign of invincibility is ourbanner, the banner of our New World Order.""I believe you, Mr. World President!", said Morris, almostunder his breath.

"No!", replied his master emphatically, "I know that you donot mean that, deep inside. But that's quite immaterial.What you believe has no meaning. The people also believemuch, but it is perfectly irrelevant. They believe in a betterworld, in a rescue, in their god! Well, Mr. Morris, if that godin whom these animals believe would really exist, I wouldpersonally liquidate him!"

The words of this man, for whom he did the most menialpaperwork, visibly intimidated Morris. Liquidate God! Morrislooked around, as if searching for an escape should onebecome necessary, but didn't dare to bestir from his place."There are only a few who could really become dangerous

197

for us, but they are quiet at present," the World President

continued, "At least, they don't show themselves openly.

But this is nothing for you, Mr. Morris," he said, his contempt

undisguised, "really nothing for you!"

He clasped his hands behind his back, and seemed to lapse

into contemplation. "We are the darkness of the world," he

said. But he was musing to himself now, and Morris did not

catch the words, "We are the darkness of the world,

whoever follows us, will never walk in light again!"

The servant inquired what the master had said, but the

question remained unanswered. Instead, the World

President raised his tone and said, emphatically: "We bring

the yoke of slavery to all nations. Who knows us knows also

that we are the lords of hate, the dark messengers of

destruction, hating the light of other men, always eager to

extinguish it.

We tore down the old world we hated so much - we gnawed

at the roots of civilization, and finally we brought it down.

We hid for a long time under the cloak of lies and distortions

- our greatest art. Our enemies - those fools! - even hailed

us. Childish maggots! Now the time of our triumph is at

hand and who shall deny us our pleasure."

"I don't know...", Morris stammered, and even scratched his

head to display the necessary confoundedness.

"You don't need to know, my faithful servant. Because

wisdom is reserved only for the wise. Ignorance casts a

shadow in the minds of those like you. That has always

been a strength to us," said the World President, and he

spun around. His dark eyes sparkled at the nervous little

man. He took the glass of orange juice, sipped it and waved

Morris dismissively in the direction of the door. Then he

turned away again.

"Goodbye, Mr. Morris!", he said flatly, his head nodding

slowly as if in affirmation of some damning, private

198

judgement about this ordinary little man, indeed about all

ordinary men.

"Good bye, Mr. World President!", answered the gray-haired

man and disappeared. With a certain relief that this

confusing conversation was over, the servant walked down

the long hallway and went to an elevator.

The head of the World Government opened a drawer and

took out a remote control. He turned to the big plasma

screen in the corner of his office and switched on the

television. On one of the news channels was a report about

the events in Paris. The man leaned back and stared at the

TV. A pretty newscaster presented the latest news from

"Central Europe" with a sad face. Some pictures of the

bombing and the mangled corpse of the governor were

shown.

Weeping people who seemed to be deeply moved by the

fate of the politician were interviewed. Even a man who

vigorously scolded at the terrorists and demanded a harder

battle against politically incorrect elements.

"More security for the people by increased supervision!" -

This was his suggestion, in order to protect mankind from

terror.

"These terrorists threaten the lifes of all respectable

people!", ranted the man.

Then the camera showed again some visitors who were

seized by sorrow and grief, because of the bombing. The

riots were mentioned only with a few words. The police had

arrested a bunch of "fanatics" and "extremists", according to

the TV report. But the security forces had finally been able

to prevent more chaos, because of their hard course against

these "criminals".

The viewer did not learn that thousands of people had been

massacred by the police and the GCF. The World President

199

just smiled. He took another sip of orange juice and turnedoff the television.

A new morning began in Ivas. A new morning in the newworld. Frank and Alfred had visited Thorsten Wilden andhad talked with him about a lot of things. After that, Frankhad walked with Julia through the nearby forest. He was justhappy to be still alive. Meanwhile, the life in the small villagehad taken its accustomed course again.In these days Frank often thought about hope. He had gothis revenge, but his fight for freedom had just been born.They say "Hope dies last!" - but what would a man bewithout it...

THE END

But the fight will go on.
